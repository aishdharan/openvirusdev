<p>The possibility of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from mother to child was identified very early after the onset of the epidemic, as early as 1983 [
 <xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. The infection of the child is characterized by a high risk of early and severe evolution with encephalopathy and death in the first 2 y of life [
 <xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. The mechanism of HIV transmission to the child during pregnancy is still hypothetical, based on indirect arguments, and probably not unequivocal. Without intervention, 15–20% of non-breastfed newborns are infected [
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]; however, only one-third of the infected children has detectable virus at birth, demonstrating that viral replication started 
 <italic>in utero</italic>, as opposed to infected children, whose virus becomes detectable only after a few weeks of life. By analogy with the dynamics of the appearance of the virus during primary infection of the adult, it is possible that contamination in the other two-thirds of infected newborns occurs 
 <italic>peri-partum</italic>. The placenta, therefore, appears to be largely protective, given the minority of children infected 
 <italic>in utero</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Most placental histopathological studies do not find specific lesions in HIV-infected women, in contrast to many other pathogens [
 <xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. There is, however, an increased risk of chorioamnionitis, but the association with the risk of transmission of the virus is still debated [
 <xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. The virus can be identified in the placenta, and phylogenetic studies between placental behavior and the blood compartment prove that an independent cycle of replication takes place. In addition to the maternal CD4 lymphocytes that it infects, the virus can be isolated from syncytiotrophoblasts and extra-vilotic mononuclear cells, especially fetal macrophages and Hofbauer cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. These cells have receptors and co-receptors (CD4, CCR5, CX R4, CD209) that allow entry of the virus, as well as Fcγ receptors capable of capturing virion–antibody complexes. The quantity of virus in placental tissue is, however, low [
 <xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. Remarkably, many studies have shown that Hofbauer cells can limit viral replication through regulatory cytokine production [
 <xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. In situations of high maternal viral blood replication, it is possible that this protective mechanism is overwhelmed, allowing passage of the virion to the free or intracellular state in the fetal circulation. Co-factors can then very likely intervene to facilitate or inhibit transmission to the child; the presence of maternal co-infection with microorganisms, such as plasmodium, mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Cytomegalovirus (CMV), is associated with a higher risk of transmission. For example, cytomegalovirus is well known for inducing placental inflammation, which may increase the number of HIV-responsive cells. Conversely, maternal neutralizing antibodies passively transmitted to the child [
 <xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>], as well as a genetic profile of relative resistance to the child’s HIV infection, may protect him [
 <xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. Events leading to infection of the child during childbirth are of another order. The risk linked to the sometimes-traumatic passage through the vagina in contact with secretions and maternal blood was first evoked. The (partial) protective effect of cesarean section initially supported this hypothesis until it was shown that only cesareans performed prior to the onset of labor had a protective effect. The phenomenon of transplacental micro-transfusion from mother to child that occurs during labor, well known in perinatal medicine, is probably the main source of 
 <italic>peri-partum</italic> infection. Elegant work based on the Human Leucocytes Antigens (HLA) homology between mother and child and the risk of HIV transmission to the child indirectly reinforces this hypothesis; greater homology would reduce allo-reactivity of the child against maternal cells and therefore their persistence and the risk of viral transmission [
 <xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. The diagnosis of infection by direct identification of the virus then requires a few weeks to be detectable by RT-PCR of the RNA (free virus) or DNA (intracellular DNA virus). The sensitivity of these two techniques is almost 100% from the age of 3 months if the child is not exposed to post-natal breastfeeding [
 <xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. If breastfed, the final diagnosis of non-infection is performed by PCR 2 to 3 weeks after weaning. Transmission through breastfeeding is transmucosal for free and intracellular virus and facilitated by the possible epithelial inflammation induced by mixed breastfeeding. The risk depends on the duration of breastfeeding but appears to be higher during the initial period because colostrum is rich in maternal immune cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>].
