<p>All antiretroviral molecules – with the exception of the fusion inhibitor (T20, Fuzéon®) – pass the placenta to varying degrees [
 <xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>], and the known pattern of toxicity of such molecules in the adult or child can be theoretically observed in the exposed newborn. Thus, reversible anemia has been linked to exposure to zidovudine, and hyper-bilirubinemia has been observed after exposure to atazanavir. Conversely, some toxicities are not, or only exceptionally, observed in exposed neonates, such as the hepatotoxicity of nevirapine, nephrotoxicity of tenofovir, or hyperlipidemia of lopinavir-r. However, the fetus may be more sensitive than adults to certain toxicities, such as mitochondrial dysfunction observed after exposure to zidovudine, didanosine, and stavudine (± lamivudine). Although such disturbances are most often asymptomatic, they can be at the origin of severe neurological syndromes and/or life-threatening hyperlactatemia [
