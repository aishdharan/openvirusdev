<p>The long-term toxicity is much more difficult to identify and evaluate. The follow-up of uninfected children beyond the period of diagnostic certainty of non-infection (6 months) is particularly difficult to organize. The identification of rare events and their comparison with the incidence observed in the general population is a process for which the complexity is often underestimated in the evaluation of the toxicity profiles of the molecules. An increased risk of cancer associated with 
 <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to didanosine was thus demonstrated several years after its use by cross-referencing data from a large cohort of children born to HIV-positive mothers and a national cancer registry [
 <xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref>]. Fortunately, didanosine – a genotoxic nucleoside analog – was very little used by pregnant women during its period of commercialization, which is now over. Other molecules of the same class do not appear to be associated with such a risk, despite a proven 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> genotoxicity profile [
 <xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>]. Given the difficulties of long-term and large-scale monitoring of exposed non-infected children, the search for a “biological signature” following maternal treatment may be justified. Such biological signatures could be used as a warning signal to target potential clinical problems and for the comparison of molecules.
