<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are well-known causes of severe infections, respiratory, enteric and systemic, in humans and numerous animal hosts. The CoV infections have been reported in cattle, swine, horses, camels, rodents, cats, dogs, bats, palm civets, ferrets, mink, rabbits, snake, and several other wild animals and avian species (Fehr and Perlman 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kahn and McIntosh 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The coronaviruses of relevant veterinary species are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> with organ affected and clinical signs. Though human CoVs were identified for the first time in the year 1960 from respiratory infections in adults as well as children, the major scientific interest in CoVs research grew only after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in the year 2002-2003 (Drosten et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Ksiazek et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Peiris et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In this SARS-CoV epidemic, around 8000 confirmed human cases with 774 deaths (around 9.5% mortality rate) occurred that was a result of its global spread (Kahn and McIntosh 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Initially, the virus was detected in the caged Himalayan palm civets and these were thought to be the natural host of this virus (Guan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Following SARS-CoV incidence in 2003, a similar CoV named HKU3-1 to HKU3-3 were identified in the horseshoe bats (non-caged) in 2005 from Hong Kong (Lau et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Since then, bats are considered to be the natural host and potential reservoir species that could be held responsible for any future CoVs epidemics and/or pandemics (Cui et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, Li et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). After the 2003 and 2005 SARS-CoV epidemics, an analogous virus emerged in the Middle East region of the world leading to severe respiratory illness and was named the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The mortality was higher than previous SARS-CoV pandemic claiming around 919 lives out of the total 2521 human cases (around 35% mortality) (World Health Organization 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Notably, dromedary camels were connected with the transmission of MERS-CoV (Alagaili et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Further, its origin was also traced from bats (Ithete et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). All these highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS and MERS, show emergence over wider areas of the world posing high risk of human-to-human transmission and fatal consequences thereto (
