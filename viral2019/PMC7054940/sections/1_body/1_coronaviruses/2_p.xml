<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) constitute a large family of viruses found in nature. CoVs belongs to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> possessing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kb in length (the largest genome of known RNA viruses) with G + C contents varying from 32 to 43%. Based on the genomic structure and phylogenetic analysis the subfamily 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> consists of four genera namely 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>. Among these 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> infects only mammals and are responsible for respiratory infection in humans and enteritis in animals. Two major zoonotic pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. The genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> further distributed in five subgenus among which 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> contains SARS-CoV and the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (de Groot et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The other subgenera under 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> are 
 <italic>Embecovirus, Hibecovirus, Merbecovirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Nobecovirus</italic>.
