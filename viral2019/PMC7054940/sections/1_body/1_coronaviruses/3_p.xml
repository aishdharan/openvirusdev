<p>The nCoV contains at least six open reading frames (ORFs) and many other accessory genes like other CoVs. The 5′ terminal two-thirds of the genome contains two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2 which encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which is further cleaved into 11 and 16 proteins, respectively. These 16 mature proteins are responsible for several important functions in genome maintenance and virus replication. The structural proteins namely spike (S), an envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid (N) are located at the one-third 3′ terminal of the genome. In addition to these genes, there are several accessory proteins which help in virus replication. The S gene is one of the most important genes for receptor binding and host specificity. Some coronaviruses have hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein in their virion.</p>
