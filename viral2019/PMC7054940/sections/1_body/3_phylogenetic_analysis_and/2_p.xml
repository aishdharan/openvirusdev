<p>Currently, knowledge about the origin of the virus, its particular receptor, clinical spectrum and host species preference is unknown. World over scientists are engaged in unraveling the genomic nature of this virus. As of now, around 15 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences (10 China and 5 USA) have been reported. To note, a report based on the codon usage analysis speculated snakes to be its natural host, whereas several subsequent reports after that publication rejected this hypothesis. They found the nearest members to be Bat_SARS-like CoVs (Bat-SL-CoVs, MG772933 &amp; MG772934) in phylogenetic analysis within the subgenus S
