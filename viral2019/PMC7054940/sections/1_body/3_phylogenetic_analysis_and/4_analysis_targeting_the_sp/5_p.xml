<p>In the genomic analysis, the S gene of 2019-nCoVs was found to exhibit lower sequence identity with other 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>. Difference in spike protein encoded by 2019-nCoV compared with the Bat SARS-like CoVs, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>. The length of ‘S’ protein of nCoV is longer (1282 amino acids) than other two viruses (SARS-1255 amino acid and BatSL-1246 amino acids) under the same 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> subgenus. The ‘S’ protein of nCoV has been detected with three short insertions at the N-terminal region, along with four changes in the receptor binding motif inside the receptor binding domain in comparison with SARS-CoV (Zhou et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Several previous studies have shown the usage of different receptors for CoVs like human ACE2 for SARS-CoV and CD26 for MERS-CoV (Lu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Identical motifs and residues to that of SARS-CoVs have been identified in the nCoV, yet they show divergence based on phylogeny (Letko and Munster 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A recent finding proves that the binding capacity of nCoV ‘S’ protein with human ACE2 is as efficient as SARS-CoV, which further promotes the human-to-human transmission (Letko and Munster 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
