<p>In the present scenario of not having any direct acting anti-viral agent and vaccines, strict implementation of high vigilance for 2019-nCoV and appropriate prevention and control measures are of utmost importance to check the further spread and control of this virus (Cheng et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Researchers and Authorities (WHO, CDC Atlanta and others) across the globe are working to combat the current ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreaks, identifying the possible origin of this novel virus, and to design and develop effective vaccines and therapeutics (Cohen

Studying the virus in details, its molecular biology and immunology, adaptive genetic changes, mutations and recombination events, elucidating clinical pathology and pathogenesis, identifying the route of origin, role of any mixing vessels (like birds, pigs, and mammals), jumping the species barrier, zoonotic potential, human-to-human transmission events, altogether would pave ways for designing effective prevention and control measures to counter 2019-nCoV
