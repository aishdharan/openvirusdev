<p>Nepal is vulnerable to the outbreak of many infectious diseases, including emerging and re-emerging diseases with significant impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health. Its rich biological diversity features three eco-climatic zones which are susceptible to invasive pathogens: tropical terai, subtropical and temperate regions in the mid-hills, and subalpine to alpine zones in the Himalaya [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Environmental degradation, changes in land-use patterns, agricultural intensification, and unplanned urbanization contribute to increased outbreaks of infectious diseases in Nepal. Moreover, low socioeconomic status, improper sanitation, poor public health facilities, and lack of awareness create a favourable situation for the emergence of and outbreaks of several infectious diseases including Japanese encephalitis (JE), malaria, and dengue fever in Nepal [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These diseases contribute significantly to socioeconomic burden in Nepal, with an increasing impact from dengue fever in recent years. Several studies on spatiotemporal epidemiology of this disease indicate that the situation is likely to worsen in the future due to climate change.
