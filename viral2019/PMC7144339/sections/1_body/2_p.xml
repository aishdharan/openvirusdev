<p>Dengue fever is an infectious viral disease from tropical and subtropical regions which is transmitted to humans from infected female mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Four dengue serotypes capable of causing infection have been identified so far (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A dramatic increase in global dengue fever in recent years has put half of the world’s population at risk, with an estimated 390 million people infected each year [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since there is no specific treatment for dengue fever, it is now considered to be one of the biggest global health crises. Dengue fever was first reported in Nepal in 2004, and was followed by outbreaks that have been larger both in geographical area and in number of people infected [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This disease is now well established in the tropical and subtropical regions of Nepal and is migrating towards the hilly region of the country due to increasing temperatures associated with climate change. During the period of the first outbreak through 2014, only 2442 cases and five deaths were reported across 32 districts [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, in the last five years, 21,858 confirmed cases have been reported across 60 districts including the mid-hills of Nepal (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Large dengue outbreaks in Nepal occurred in 2010 (917 cases), 2013 (683 cases), and 2016 (1,527 cases) [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During these outbreaks, the major serotypes were identified as DENV-1 in 2010 and 2016, and DENV-2 in 2013 [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. All four infectious serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1–4) are present within the hosts, vectors, and the ecosystems of Nepal [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In 2019, the worst epidemic to date developed with 14,662 confirmed cases (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], indicating a major shift in the temporal and spatial spread of dengue in Nepal. More than two serotypes are estimated to be involved in the current outbreak, and patients are exhibiting considerable differences in symptoms compared to previous years.
