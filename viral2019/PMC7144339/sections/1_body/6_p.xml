<p>Some independent research has been conducted to evaluate the spatial and temporal spread of dengue fever in Nepal [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These studies have provided the basis of understanding the factors that contribute to dengue incidence, epidemic outbreak, spread at different scales, and spatial and temporal clustering of disease. This information is very important for devising appropriate disease control strategies. Among several epidemiological parameters, the pathogen’s dispersal kernel most strongly influences the spread of the disease and the efficacy of control strategies. Since dengue fever exhibits long-distance dispersal (LDD) through its mosquito vector, the potential for it to rapidly spread over large spatial scales is greatly concerning. Traditionally, disease spread was modelled using a travelling wave approach with an epidemic front of constant velocity calculated using the pathogen’s reproductive capacity, generation time, dispersal ability, and vectors. However, disease spread for the pathogens exhibiting LDD is better characterized by fat-tailed dispersal kernels resulting in accelerating epidemic fronts [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Understanding these characteristics of epidemic spread is essential for the development of models that capture the large-scale processes that enable epidemiologists (or health care officials) to rapidly predict patterns such as rate of spread and the efficacy of potential outbreak interventions.
