<p>Some control measures for dengue fever have been effective in partially reducing the disease burden, yet these still fall below the level of control sought by the government as outlined in their Dengue Report [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This lag in control is due to a lack of trained professionals, inadequate monitoring and reporting systems, and insufficient designated departments authorized for carrying out large-scale control methods such as medical entomology. Therefore, the GoN should adopt stringent prevention and control measures by strengthening the disease surveillance system, upgrading the healthcare system with advanced facilities, and controlling the vector population to prevent and contain dengue epidemics. Additional research should be carried out to better understand the patterns of dengue outbreak, serotypes and genotypes involved, local and long-distance dispersal of mosquito vectors with the virus, spatial scaling of disease outbreak, and other epidemiological factors. Special attention should be paid to initial disease prevalence and spatial patterns, basic reproduction number of vector and the virus, and efficacy of control strategies. Environmental and demographic factors that influence dengue fever outbreaks should also be thoroughly considered while developing management strategies. All impacted sectors including every individual, household, and community should work proactively in conjunction with the government during periods of disease outbreaks at different temporal and spatial scales.
