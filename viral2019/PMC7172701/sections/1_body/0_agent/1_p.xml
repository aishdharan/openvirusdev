<p>Coronaviruses belong to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> which includes four genera, 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, as well as several subgenera and species. Coronaviruses are found in a variety of animals and humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the A lineage (subgenus 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic>) of genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. HCoVs were first isolated in cell culture in the 1960s from persons with upper respiratory infections. These were later characterized as HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in the early 2000s from persons with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In 2002 a 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> in lineage B (subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>) originating in bats, then spread from civets to humans in the Guangdong province of southern China, causing severe respiratory disease, and taking the name severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2012 a 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> in lineage C (subgenus 
 <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>) spread from camels to humans in Saudi Arabia, causing a similar clinical syndrome as SARS, taking the name Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [
