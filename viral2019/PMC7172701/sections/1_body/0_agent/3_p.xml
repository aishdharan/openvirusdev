<p>Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses containing a single strand of positive-sense RNA. Virions are mostly spherical, with pronounced spiked glycoprotein (S) embedded in the envelope. Additional structural proteins include envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Intra- and inter-species transmission of CoVs, and genetic recombination events contribute to the emergence of new CoV strains [
