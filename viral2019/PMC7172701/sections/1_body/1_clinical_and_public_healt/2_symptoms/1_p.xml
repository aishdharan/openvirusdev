<p>Infections caused by endemic HCoVs have an incubation period of 2–5 days and are associated with mild upper respiratory symptoms (the “common cold”). Endemic HCoVs are among the most frequent cause of upper respiratory tract infections. Lower respiratory tract infections (bronchiolitis, pneumonia) are rare. Following an incubation period of usually 4–5 days, patients infected with SARS-CoV often present with symptoms of fever, headache, and myalgias. Respiratory symptoms including cough and dyspnoea usually develop from several days to a week after illness onset. Atypical pneumonia and respiratory deterioration occur in 20–30% of cases. The incubation period and clinical course of MERS are similar to that of SARS, the exception being a higher proportion of cases progressing to respiratory deterioration and distress. The incubation period and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection are probably similar to that of SARS. Li et al. first reported a mean incubation period of 5.2 days [
