<p>It must be appreciated that no matter how accurate and fast laboratory testing methods are, the diagnosis of viral pneumonias such as caused by SARS-CoV-2 involves collecting the correct specimen from the patient at the right time. The endemic HCoVs have been detected from a variety of upper and lower respiratory sources including throat, nasal nasopharyngeal (NP), sputum, and bronchial fluid [

 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Wang et al have just reported that oropharyngeal (OP) swabs (

 <italic>n</italic> = 8) in China during the COVID-19 outbreak; however, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected only in 32% of OP swabs, which was significantly lower than that in NP swabs (63%)[

Accessed 16 March 2020). Swab specimens should be placed in a universal or viral transport medium. Nasopharyngeal aspirates are also suitable specimens for the detection of HCoVs.
