<p>In China, at the time of revising, eleven molecular devices from Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech, Shanghai GeneoDx Biotech, BGI Biotech (Wuhan), MGI Tech, Da An Gene, Sansure Biotech, Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotech Capitalbio (Chengdu), Beijing Applied Biological Technologies, Maccura Biotechnology, and Wuhan Easydiagnosis Biomedicine have received urgent approval from NMPA and their characteristics are contrasted in 
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Variable performance has been reported on these devices [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In their registration certificates, it was clearly indicated that the certificate was for urgent and supplemental diagnosis of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Additional multi-centre clinical trial data are needed for extension after one year. Among them, one (MGI Tech) uses its NGS technique to detect all pathogens in a given specimen including SARS-CoV-2 and the other one (Innovita) uses its isothermal amplification followed by chip detection. The other nine devices incorporated real-time PCR technique with hydrolysis probes. After nucleic acids get extracted (separated reagents and systems), the extracts are transferred to a real-time PCR thermocycler (e.g. ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument) for nucleic acid amplification and detection.
