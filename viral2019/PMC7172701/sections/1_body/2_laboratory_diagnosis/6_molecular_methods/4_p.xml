<p>The US CDC developed developed a RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for universal detection of SARS-like betacoronaviruses and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Three separate RT-PCR reactions target the N gene. One primer/probe set detects all betacoronaviruses, while two sets are specific for SARS-CoV-2. All 3 assays must be positive to report presumptive positive for SARS-CoV-2 (

Accessed 15 March 2020). Specimen types included upper and lower respiratory specimens (such as NP or OP swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract aspirates, BAL, and nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate). It received emergency use authorization (EUA) on 4 February 2020. At the time of revision, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted thirteen in vitro diagnostics EUAs: the aforementioned CDC assay; the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health); TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.); cobas SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.; Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 (Hologic, Inc.); COVID-19 RT-PCR Test (Laboratory Corporation of America); Lyra SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Quidel Corp.); Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR (Quest Diagnostics Infectious Disease, Inc.); Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (Abbott Molecular); Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (DiaSorin Molecular LLC); ePlex SARS-CoV-2 Test (GenMark Diagnostics, Inc.); Primerdesign Ltd COVID-19 genesig Real-Time PCR assay (Primerdesign Ltd); and Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test (Cepheid) (
