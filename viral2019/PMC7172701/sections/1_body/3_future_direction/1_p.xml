<p>All three novel coronaviruses are highly contagious. Fast, safe, simple to use diagnostic devices performed at or near the point of care (POC) (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) which have been shown to impact patient management and control of infectious disease epidemics [
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], are extremely desirable in POC when biosafety facility is limited (
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Several manufactures have been spending efforts to generate devices for POC testing (POCT) [
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The ID NOW™ (previously Alere i) Influenza A &amp; B assay (Abbott, San Diego, CA) was cleared by the US FDA for direct use on NP swabs as the first-ever Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived nucleic acid-based test in January 2016 [
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Similarly, the Xpert
 <sup>®</sup> Xpress Flu/RSV (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and cobas
 <sup>®</sup> Liat
 <sup>®</sup> Flu A/B &amp; RSV (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA) assays are integrated nucleic acid extraction-independent devices that have recently received FDA clearance and CLIA-waiver for simultaneous detection and identification of FluA, FluB, and RSV in nasopharyngeal swabs [
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The FilmArray
 <sup>®</sup> Respiratory EZ Panel (BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT) so far so far is the only CLIA-waived syndromic panel that covers a set of 14 respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens including classical coronavirus species [
 <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].
