<p>Considering the increased levels of mortality and infectivity associated with three novel-coronavirus outbreaks, these random-access, safe and simple tests, which offer fast and accurate detection and identification, are likely to have an immediate impact on prompt clinical and epidemiological decisions [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Lysis buffer can be used to inactivate the infectivity of specimens so the testing can be run at POC when a biosafety cabinet is not available. Fast near-patient and POCT could help more efficiently triage of suspected cases of novel coronavirus, helping to focus limited resources on enabling appropriate use of quarantine. A handful of diagnostics developers are now striving to bring fast SARS-CoV-2 tests to market as soon as possible, with hopes of ultimately assisting with the ongoing outbreak in China. Molecular diagnostic tests for use at the are in development from Cepheid and HiberGene (Dublin, Ireland). Cepheid has some advantages in the molecular POCT space because it already has instruments placed in China. Mobidiag, meanwhile, may offer additional benefits with a multiplex test for coronavirus and Flu viruses (
