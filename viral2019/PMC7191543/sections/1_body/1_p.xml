<p id="Par2">Telemedicine is not a viable alternative in the South African public health system. Consequently, all patients are screened at the hospital gate for acute respiratory symptoms before entering. Those with possible COVID-19 symptoms are given surgical masks and isolated for clinical assessment, treatment and testing. Inside the hospital, social distancing is adhered to as strictly as possible. In one clinic, rather than sitting in a crowded waiting area, patients are asked to wait 1.5Â m apart from each other outside and brought into the building for their visit or pharmacy collection 5 patients at a time. As much as possible, chronic medications are packaged and delivered by community health workers to community-based locations.</p>
