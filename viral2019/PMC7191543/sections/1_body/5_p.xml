<p id="Par6">To facilitate the rollout of TLD with de-escalated HIV services, the WC DoH and the Southern African HIV Clinicians Society (SAHCS) issued specific recommendations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The SAHCS strongly advocated that 6-month supplies of ARVs be issued to stable patients, reducing the risk of COVID-19 exposure inherent in seeking in-person treatment at healthcare facilities as well as to minimize patient flow in a clinic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ideally, to change from TEE to TLD a patient should have a VL &lt; 50 copies/mL within 6 months, as stipulated by national guidelines. However, the SAHCS and WC DoH advocated switching a patient to TLD, even without a recent VL, if the patient has been on ARVs for &gt; 1 year, the past 2 VLs were &lt; 50 copies/mL, and they have regularly collected ARVs over the past year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patients fulfilling these criteria are very likely to be suppressed and can be switched to TLD without delay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, the WC DoH urged same day initiation of ARVs when not medically contraindicated, ARV initiation for all co-infected TB patients 2 weeks after starting TB treatment, and urgently changing all patients failing 1
 <sup>st</sup> line TEE to a 2
 <sup>nd</sup> line ARV regimen, preferably with dolutegravir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients unsuppressed on ARVs will need additional clinical contact and adherence support. The SAHCS and WC DoH recommendations seek to fast-track PLHIV onto a robust ARV regimen during the pandemic to maximize their possibility of viral suppression and minimize their exposure to the healthcare system and, potentially, COVID-19.
