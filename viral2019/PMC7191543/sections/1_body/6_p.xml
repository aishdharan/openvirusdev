<p id="Par7">The uncertainty is what impact this de-escalated HIV program will have on HIV outcomes in South Africa. Unsuppressed patients in need of additional adherence support are likely to suffer the most without the help of auxiliary services such as social work, treatment support groups, addiction rehabilitation, and psychotherapy. Likewise, many of South Africaâ€™s lay HIV-counselors have been re-deployed to community COVID-19 screening. Although HIV testing is ongoing, anecdotally testing numbers and new diagnoses of HIV are lower since the WC DoH began discouraging non-essential healthcare visits. HIV self-testing at home or HIV testing in coordination with community COVID-19 screens could potentially fill that gap.</p>
