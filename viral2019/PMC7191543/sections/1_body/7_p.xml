<p id="Par8">It is well documented that differentiated models of care, such as South Africa’s adherence clubs, for stable ARV patients have improved long-term virologic suppression and retention in care in comparison to usual care [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. PLHIV are more likely to continue treatment if it is convenient and they can keep working without sitting all day in un-friendly, stigmatizing clinics to collect medication. In fact, the WHO recommends that clinically stable patients receive ARV refills every 3–6 months to decrease the burden of care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Forced by the pandemic, the WC DoH has advised clinicians to give stable patients up to 6 months of refills of a highly efficacious ARV—TLD—with minimal clinic contact. We have effectively turned most of the HIV service into one giant alternative model of care. It is possible that without the burden of frequent visits, there might be improved retention in care during the pandemic because patients are given the medication and empowered to manage their own health. The roll-out of TLD will confound outcomes, because it will be impossible to tease out if viral suppression rates are due to the better ARV, less burdensome healthcare system, or both.
