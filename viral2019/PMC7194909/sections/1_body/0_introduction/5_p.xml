 </xref>. The argument is that economic narratives, stories that offer interpretations of economic events, or morals, of hints of theories about the economy, go viral just as diseases do, because of changes in the environment and of simple mutations of the narratives that put the contagion rate above the recovery rate, as in the

 <xref rid="fn0010" ref-type="fn">2</xref> The economy is continually beset by multiple narratives, some going viral, some peaking, some fading away, and some positive in their effects on the economy, some negative, whose summed effects alter economic behavior to produce economic fluctuations. Like diseases, many of these economic narratives are perennial, and fade into a low background level until some mutation or change in conditions causes them to mysteriously explode into a renewed epidemic.
