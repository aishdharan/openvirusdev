<p id="par0035">The longest expansion is easily visible from a glance at the data. 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows U.S. real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) from 1929 to the present, along with per capita real personal consumption expenditures, both from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in a semi log plot, which makes it easy to observe the percentage changes in the series. The expansion follows the “Great Recession” of 2007–2009, and is seen, indicated by the words “longest expansion,” at the far right. The growth of log real GDP per capita is almost a linear uptrend for over ten years, though the consumption component appears more like a broken straight line, the first segment showing a very slow recovery 2009–2014, the second segment, 2015–2020, showing a faster recovery.
