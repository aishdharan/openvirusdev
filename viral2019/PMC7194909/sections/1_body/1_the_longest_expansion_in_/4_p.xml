<p id="par0045">The standard deviation of ln GDP and ln consumption around their quadratic trends is only about 3% in the time since 1947 when U.S. GDP became quarterly, rather than just annual. The percentage fluctuations around the trend, reflecting occasional recessions, may seem pretty small when compared with the extent of talk and trepidation that recessions bring. Most people, if asked, “did you spend something like 3% more or less around lifetime trend last year?” would likely have no idea how to answer. They might be able to think of some major expenditures that they made, or decided not to make last year, like buying a new car, or taking a long anticipated major vacation trip. Beyond that, plus or minus a few percent is just too small to even remember. Any of the blips down were within a few years offset by increases that set per capita values to new record levels. It is important to remember this when judging the likely impact of the narratives discussed below. The impact of these narratives on spending does not need to be very large to explain a good deal of the economic fluctuations we observe.</p>
