<p id="par0055">Longer expansions have tended to be the slower expansions, as can be seen from 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> , which is a scatter diagram with one point for every expansion since 1947, with the expansions labeled by their final year. The x axis shows the length of the expansion in quarters, the y axis the growth rate of the expansion per annum. The longest expansion, which is labeled with 2019 though it may extend to further years, can be seen at the bottom and far right. The news media have generally described the longest expansion in glowing terms, as a singular success, when they might as well have described it as the slowest.
