<p id="par0065">To help understand the longest expansion, we seek to find key words that are markers for constellations of economic narratives that might be regarded as at least partly exogenous forces to help explain it, and to search Proquest News &amp; Newspapers for them. Proquest makes it possible to search 97 million articles since 1989, including the years leading up to the financial crisis, the crisis years 2008–2009, and the years of the longest expansion since 2009. We seek to find changes in narratives that might have been part of the cause of the expansion, or that hindered it. Six of our hypothesized constellations of narratives impacting spending are shown, with key words “Great Depression,” “Secular Stagnation,” “Sustainability,” (shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ) and with key words “Housing Bubble,” “Strong Economy” and “Save More” (shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ).
