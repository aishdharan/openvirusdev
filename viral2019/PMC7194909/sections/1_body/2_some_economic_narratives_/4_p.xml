 <bold>Secular Stagnation</bold>.” This term was reintroduced into the public consciousness by Lawrence Summers, a celebrity figure, former president of Harvard, former U.S. Treasury Secretary and research powerhouse, in a speech at a 2013 research conference of the International Monetary Fund, which went viral. The term goes back to the Great Depression itself, when it was coined by Alvin Hansen in his 1938 presidential address before the American Economic Association, but was largely forgotten until Summers resurrected it. Lending his prestige to the narrative created more contagion to the narrative, for a while. The curve is hump-shaped, like an epidemic curve again. It comes a little later than the Great Depression narrative because it took a while for Summers to bless it. It is smaller than the Great Depression curve, possibly because a great many people do not know the intended meaning (long-term) of “secular.” But the message of the narratives attached to this phrase are surely inhibitory of spending, since they suggest that bad times will be here indefinitely. Secular stagnation appears forgotten again by the time of Trump's presidency, which might work in the direction of giving the expansion more time at the end.
