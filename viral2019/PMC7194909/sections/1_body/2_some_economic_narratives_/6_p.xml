 <bold>Housing Bubble</bold>.” This displays another nice epidemic curve, starting to rise well before the 2008–2009 financial crisis but really going viral in 2008. The term “housing bubble” was the product of the interbreeding of two narratives, the housing boom narrative and the stock market bubble narrative, which had never created a contagious pathogen until now.
