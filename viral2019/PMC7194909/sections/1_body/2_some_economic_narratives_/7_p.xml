<p id="par0090">“Strong Economy.” The phrase “strong economy” shows two epidemics, one in the late 1990s, the other in 2018–2019. This might be nothing more than a reflection of the high stock market of both of those occasions, but I think there is also feedback at work from the narrative to the economy. Referring to the economy as “strong,” suggests a medical analogy, like a “strong constitution.” There was a mutation of the “strong economy” metaphor when President Donald Trump attached himself to it. He projects as a giant strongman who incorporates strength into his campaign, as with his slogan “Make America Great Again” which he borrowed from the 1980 Ronald Reagan presidential campaign. Sixty-two percent of Proquest News &amp; Newspaper hits for “strong economy” 2017–2019 also mention President Trump, and often mention his slogan “Make America Great Again.” In contrast, only 27% of hits for “strong economy” near the end of the second-longest expansion, 1997–1999, mention then-president Clinton.
