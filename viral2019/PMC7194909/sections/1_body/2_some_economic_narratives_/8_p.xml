 <bold>Save More.</bold>” These words key for the opposite message from that of the strong economy message, that most people do not save enough, that risks are high, for their plans to buy a house someday, to put their children through college, to start a business or to retire well. Sometimes the “Save More” phrase attaches to narratives that are only tangentially related to such long-term plans, like how to save more on your heating bills, or on grocery shopping, but more often it appears to be about accumulating saving. The “Save More” message more than doubled in strength with the financial crisis year 2008, undoubtedly helped along by the crisis. In the few years after the financial crisis there were many articles about the debt trap, and about the student loan trap, about the dangers of indebtedness, that were related, if themselves less viral. But gradually, in accordance with epidemic theory, they were eventually less well-remembered, and went back to their former levels. President Donald Trump, elected in 2016 and one of the most viral celebrities of all time, launched a counter-narrative of “save more,” with his call to lavish living: “If you are going to think, think big. If you are going to live, live large.”
