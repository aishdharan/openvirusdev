<p id="par0110">We need more research that would help establish narratives more securely. As I have discussed in my recent book, we need to develop better data sources about narratives, such as provided by focus interviews and focus groups, not relying so much on news media reporting, and more representative of the population at large. We need to use quantifications of narratives to establish direction of causality between narratives and economic events better. There are already econometric techniques that help us understand direction of causality that can be applied once quantification of data on narratives is more developed. Narrative epidemic models may eventually be combined with extant econometric models of the economy.</p>
