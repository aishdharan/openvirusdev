<p id="p0090">In conclusion, the actual pandemic event is demonstrating that infectious diseases represent one of the key challenges for human society. The periodic emergence of viral agents shows an increasing correlation with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors (

Our findings, if confirmed by future studies, suggest that air quality should also be considered as part of an integrated approach toward sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads. However, the role of atmospheric pollution should be considered in a long-term, chronic perspective, and adoption of mitigation actions only during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility. We need to highlight that our analyses did not include other important determinants of Covid-19 incidence and mortality, such as age structure, lifestyle factors (e.g. diet or smoking habits), the prevalence of pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory problems and diabetes prior to the pandemic, the capacity of the healthcare system, the case identification practices (e.g. the percentage of the population that were tested and the percentage of positive tests to the total number of tests), and the duration of the confinement, among others. Given these limitations, our findings should be interpreted as more hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory. As such, we call for future studies to fill this gap of knowledge by addressing at which extent the aforementioned factors may have mutually contributed to the diffusion of Covid-19 in Italy.
