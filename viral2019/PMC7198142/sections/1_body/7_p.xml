<p id="p0065">The long-term condition of population exposure is also revealed by the number of days per year in which the regulatory limits of O
 <sub>3</sub> and PM
 <sub>10</sub> are exceeded (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A–B): the critical situation of Northern Italy is reflected by values of up to 80 days of exceedance per year (average of the last three years, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">EAA, 2019</xref>). Worthy to remind, ozone is one of the main precursors for the formation of NO
 <sub>2</sub>, and chronic exposure to this contaminant for almost a quarter of a year is undoubtedly of primary importance. The chronic air pollution in Northern Italy is further represented by the number of years during the last decade (2010–2019) in which the limit value for PM
 <sub>10</sub> (50 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup> per day) has been exceeded for at least 35 days (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Once again, these data would provide evidence that the whole Northern area below the Alpine arc has been constantly exposed to significantly higher levels of these contaminants.
