<p id="par0020">Viral infection is becoming a disaster threatening human health because of the emergence of new respiratory viruses such as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is spreading in China (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Munster et al., 2020</xref>), as well as influenza A H1N1, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that emerged in the past decade (

 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, 2020</xref>), and the disease caused by 2019-nCoV was named as COVID-19, short for “coronavirus disease 2019”, by 
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (2020)</xref>. However, other respiratory viruses, even though not that widely spreading, can cause similar symptoms as 2019-nCoV and should not be ignored. Here, we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed the characteristics of different respiratory viral infections.
