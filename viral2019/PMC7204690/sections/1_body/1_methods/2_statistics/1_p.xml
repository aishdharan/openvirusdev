<p id="par0055">Statistical analysis was finished by SPSS Statistics 17.0. The normality of the distribution was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Group t-test was applied to the normal distribution data, and the Mann–Whitney U test was applied to the non-normal distribution data. Data are shown as means ± SD or median(25%–75%). A Chi-square test was used for comparison of two or multiple rates or components. Analyses were presented as two-sided comparisons. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.</p>
