<p id="par0060">Overall, 1860 patients were screened in a fever clinic. 136 (7.31%) patients with positive nasal and pharyngeal swab tests for Flu A virus, Flu B virus, 2019-nCoV, or RSV were enrolled in the analysis. The selection process and etiological composition are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ; the baseline features of the patients are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> . The median age of the patients was 37.00(27.00–58.75). The ratio of males and females was 1:1.31. Seventy-two (52.94%) patients were diagnosed with Flu A virus infection. Thirty-two (23.53%) of the patients were diagnosed with Flu B virus infection. Eighteen (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and RSV infection, respectively. There was no statistical difference in the sex ratio among the four groups (P &gt; 0.05). No statistical differences were found in the age of the patients among Flu A virus infection, COVID-19, and RSV infection groups (P &gt; 0.05). However, the age of Flu B virus infection group [32.00(26.00–37.00)] was younger than other groups (P &lt; 0.05). The COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with an epidemic area within 14 days and clustering onset than other groups (P &lt; 0.05). No other epidemic history was statistically different among the four groups (P &gt; 0.05). 36 (26.47%) patients had comorbidities, the most common of which was hypertension (8.96%). The less common comorbidities were malignant tumor (7.46%), heart disease (5.97%), diabetes mellitus (5.22%), chronic lung disease (4.48%), autoimmune disease (2.99%), chronic liver disease (1.49%) and chronic kidney disease (0.75%). RSV infection patients had a higher risk of having comorbidities than the COVID-19 group (P = 0.010); however, no differences were found in the rate of comorbidities among other groups (P &gt; 0.05).
