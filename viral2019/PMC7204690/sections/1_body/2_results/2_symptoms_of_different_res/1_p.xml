<p id="par0065">Fever was the most common symptom in respiratory viral infection patients. All patients with Flu A virus infection had a fever; the ratio was higher than that in COVID-19 and RSV infection patients (P &lt; 0.05). The highest temperature was higher in the Flu A infection group (38.53 ± 0.56) than in the COVID-19 group [38.00(37.60–38.50)] (P = 0.004). The percentage of pharyngalgia in the COVID-19 group was lower than in the Flu A group (P = 0.018). The Flu B virus infection group had a higher rate of myalgia or fatigue than the COVID-19 and RSV infection groups (P = 0.016 and 0.047, respectively). The rate of headache in Flu A and B viral infection patients was higher than that in the COVID-19 group (P = 0.001 and &lt;0.001 respectively). No other symptoms such as cough, sputum, rhinorrhea, etc. were found statistically different among the groups (P &gt; 0.05). The days from onset to visit and the pulse oxygen saturation (SpO
 <sub>2</sub>) at room air were not different among the groups (P &gt; 0.05).
