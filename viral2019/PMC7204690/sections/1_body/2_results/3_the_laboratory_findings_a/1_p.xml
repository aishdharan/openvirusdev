<p id="par0070">There was no statistical difference in complete blood count parameters between Flu A and B infection groups (P &gt; 0.05). COVID-19 patients had a lower white blood cell (WBC) count and neutrophil count than the Flu A virus infection group (P = 0.022 and 0.002, respectively) and RSV infection group (P &lt; 0.001 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Also, Flu A (P = 0.019 and 0.027 respectively) and Flu B (P = 0.001 and 0.005 respectively) virus infection groups had lower WBC and neutrophil count than the RSV infection group. The lymphocyte count was lower in Flu A and B virus infection groups than in the COVID-19 group (P = 0.001 and 0.005 respectively) and RSV infection group (P = 0.015 and 0.038 respectively); however, there was no lymphocyte count difference between the COVID-19 group and RSV infection group (P = 0.600). The RSV infection group had lower hemoglobin levels than other groups (P &lt; 0.05), and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) than the COVID-19 (P = 0.025) and Flu B infection groups (P = 0.049). CRP was not statistically different among Flu A and B infection and COVID-19 groups (P &gt; 0.05). No other differences in laboratory parameters were found between the groups (P &gt; 0.05).</p>
