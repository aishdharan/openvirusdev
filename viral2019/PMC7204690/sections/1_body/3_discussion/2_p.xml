 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), fever was the most common symptom in respiratory virus infection patients. In this study, the ratio of fever to the highest temperature was higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. Given the absence of fever and low-grade fever in COVID-19 patients and its high risk (

Even though the rate of pharyngalgia, headache, myalgia, and fatigue were relatively higher in influenza infection groups, it could not be said that the presence of these symptoms was meaningful for excluding COVID-19 because they were not specific symptoms in different respiratory virus infection. In fact, no specific symptoms were helpful in distinguishing COVID-19 from other respiratory virus infections (
