<p id="par0090">As previously reported, COVID-19 patients had low or normal WBC and neutrophil count (

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>), this study found that the lymphocyte count was higher in COVID-19 than in Flu A and B virus infection patients. These results showed that low WBC, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were suggestive of viral infection, but could not distinguish different between the respiratory-virus groups. Also, even though the CRP level was higher in the RSV infection group than in COVID-19 and Flu B infection groups, it was not statistically different in Flu A infection, Flu B infection, and COVID-19 groups. Lower WBC and lymphocyte levels and higher CRP levels might be more valuable in monitoring disease severity rather than in screening for COVID-19 (
