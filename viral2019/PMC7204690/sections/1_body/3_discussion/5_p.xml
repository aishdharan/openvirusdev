<p id="par0100">There are some limitations to this study. First, only one center was enrolled in the study. It might not be that representative of the whole city of Beijing. Second, most patients, especially the COVID-19 patients, were mild cases on the first visit. They were not representative of respiratory viral infections of varying severity. Third, no follow-up data were available in this study, therefore it was impossible to analyze the whole clinical course of different virus infections.</p>
