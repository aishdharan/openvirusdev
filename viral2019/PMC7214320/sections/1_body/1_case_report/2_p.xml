<p id="p0015">A 70-year-old woman presented with a history of intermittent fever for 2 days. She had traveled from the epidemic area of Hubei to Dali. Her highest recorded temperature was 38.0 °C; in addition she had a wet cough characterized by a small amount of sputum that was white in color and easy to expectorate. There was no cold sensitivity, chills, muscle aches, chest tightness, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, chest pain, or other discomfort. Her medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, her temperature was 38.0 °C, her blood pressure was 146/67 mmHg, and coarse breath sounds were auscultated in both lungs; no other abnormalities were found. Chest CT revealed multiple ground glass opacities (GGOs) in both lungs, predominantly distributed subpleurally and in the middle and lateral lung fields, especially in the right lung, where they had partially fused into patches. Local interlobular septal thickening was also observed. Consequently, the possibility of viral pneumonia was considered (

 <sup>9</sup>/L; normal reference values: 4–10 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L) and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (18 mg/L; normal reference values: 0–3.00 mg/L). Throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, thus confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19.
