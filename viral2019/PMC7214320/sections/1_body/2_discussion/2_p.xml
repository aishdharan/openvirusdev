<p id="p0020">COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 that is predominantly characterized by pulmonary inflammation, but can also involve other organs [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The main routes of transmission are droplet and contact transmission, involving both animal-to-person and person-to-person transmission. Aerosol transmission is possible when exposed to a high aerosol concentration for a long period in a relatively closed environment. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days, most commonly 3â€“7 days, and the elderly are more susceptible to this infection. The major clinical manifestations are fever, fatigue, and dry cough and can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The principal confirmatory laboratory test is the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, which is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Additionally, reduced total white blood cell and lymphocyte counts and elevated liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase levels are observed in some patients along with elevated CRP levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate noted in the majority of patients. Our patient was from an epidemic area, and the clinical manifestations were presented with a history of intermittent fever which was accompanied by a wet cough. Laboratory tests demonstrated a reduced total white blood cell count and elevated CRP level which was consistent with the findings in other reports.
