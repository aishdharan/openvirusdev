<p id="p0030">However, the imaging findings of COVID-19 lack specificity and CT should mainly be used in differentiating the disease from other viral pneumonias. Viral pneumonia generally manifests as pulmonary interstitial changes with alveolar wall edema. The CT findings mainly include GGOs, partial fusion and consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, grid-like shadows, and fibrous cord-like shadows. Given the similarities in the imaging findings of different viral pneumonias, however, a diagnosis of COVID-19 should be considered only after taking into account the clinical data, epidemiology, and laboratory test results, and the final diagnosis should be confirmed by pathogenic tests. Furthermore, COVID-19 must be differentiated from non-viral pneumonia such as bacterial pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumonia (both common in children and adolescents), non-infectious diseases such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia and allergic pneumonia, and mixed infections.</p>
