<p>Belonging to the 
 <italic>β‐coronavirus</italic> genus of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, SARS‐CoV‐2 is closely related to SARS‐CoV as there is more than 70% nucleotide similarity in their approximately 30 kb long genomes.

 <italic>β‐coronaviruses</italic> causing human infections such as SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV‐2 originated from bats, and reported 96% genomic identity with a previously detected SARS‐like bat coronavirus.
