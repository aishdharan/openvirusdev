<p>In the case of such an epidemic, it is important to make as reliable as possible an estimate of the basic reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>, the number of cases generated from a single infected person) and the dynamics of transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal origin, rate of viral evolution and population dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 using 52 full genomes of viral strains sampled in different countries on known sampling dates available at the moment when the study was performed.
