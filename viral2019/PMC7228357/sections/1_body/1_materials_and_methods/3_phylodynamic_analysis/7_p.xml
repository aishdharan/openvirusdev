<p>The basic reproductive number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) was calculated on the basis of the exponential growth rate (
 <italic>r</italic>) using the equation 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 
 <italic>rD</italic> + 1, where 
 <italic>D</italic> is the average duration of infectiousness estimated as described below.
