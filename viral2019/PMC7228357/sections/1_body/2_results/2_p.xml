<p>The sequence analyses under a relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) or strict molecular clock showed that the former performed better as assessed by using BF with PS and SS (strict vs relaxed molecular clock BF(PS) = −8.66 and BF(SS) = −10.7 for relaxed clock). Comparison of the different demographic models showed that the BSP model best fitted the data (BSP vs exponential growth BF(PS) = 7.3 and BF(SS) = 8.78 for BSP; BSP vs constant population size BF(PS)= 8.3; and BF(SS) = 10.7 for BSP).</p>
