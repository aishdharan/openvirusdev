<p>The Bayesian tree showed three main significant clades. The largest clade (pp = .84) encompassed 10 sequences and consisted of two significant subclades (pp = .9 and pp = 1). Overall, this cluster included fewer recent isolates than the other two clusters, and dated back to 47.5 days ago (95% HPD, 25.5‐76.6), corresponding to 13 December 2019. The second (pp = .99) and third significant clusters (pp = .95) dated back to 29.2 (95% HPD, 0.7‐47.45) and 21.9 (95% HPD 3.6‐54.7) days ago, corresponding to 1 to 8 January 2020.</p>
