The epidemic originated an estimated mean of 3.7 months (CI, 3‐4) before the present (BP), corresponding to October to November 2019, before the root tree (3.6 months BP). The estimated recovery rate (the time to becoming noninfectious) was 7.3 days (CI, 4.7‐16.5 days), whereas the transmission rate (
