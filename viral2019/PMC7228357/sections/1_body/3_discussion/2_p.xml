<p>The SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic is unique in the history of human infectious diseases not only because it is caused by a novel virus, but also because of the immediate availability of epidemiological and genomic data (the first entire genome was published on 24 December 2019). The prompt availability of research data on internet platforms such as the GISAID has allowed us and other research groups to make a phylogenetic reconstruction of the origin of SARS‐CoV‐2 and to share these findings with other scientists.</p>
