<p>The temporal reconstruction of the SARS‐CoV‐2 phylogeny obtained in the present study is in line with previous estimates and suggests that the epidemic originated between October and November 2019, several weeks before the first cases were described. This was confirmed by means of coalescent analysis and the birth‐death method of estimating the origin of the epidemic. The estimated evolutionary rate is also in line with that of SARS and MERS viruses,
