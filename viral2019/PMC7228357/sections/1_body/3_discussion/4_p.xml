<p>One of the most important epidemiological parameters when monitoring an epidemic is 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (ie, the number of secondary cases induced by a single infected individual in a totally susceptible population) because it is fundamental to assess the potential spread of a microorganism. Its value changes during an epidemic being called the effective reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>e</sub>). 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is usually estimated on the basis of the growth rate of the number of cases. The available epidemiological estimates of SARS‐CoV‐2 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> range from 2.2 to 2.9, although they changed from 1.4 to more than 7 during the first phases of the epidemic.
