<p>On the same basis, the estimated epidemic doubling time was 3.6 days with a CI between 1 and 7 days. We also tried to calculate it on the basis of the transmission (
 <italic>λ</italic>) and recovery rate (
 <italic>δ</italic>) estimated using the birth‐death model, which lead to an estimated mean doubling time of 4.1 days, with the most probable values falling between 3.9 and 4.3 days. Previous studies have suggested that the doubling time during the early phases of the epidemic was approximately 7.4 days.
