<p>This preliminary study has some limitations. The R values and doubling times were estimated phylogenetically using all of the whole genomes available in a public database at the time the study was carried out (

Given the small number of sequences and the relatively short sampling period, the CIs are wide and limit the precision of the estimates. Moreover, the analysis included isolates collected outside mainland China as it is assumed that they all belong to the same epidemic originating in Wuhan.
