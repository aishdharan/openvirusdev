As of 8 February 2020, a total of 37,198 confirmed cases and 28,942 suspected cases, including 6,188 cases of severe illness, 811 deaths cases, and 2,649 cured cases, were reported by the National Health Commission of China.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Cases have also been reported in 24 countries outside of China.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> According to the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the <italic>Diagnosis and Treatment Program of Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia</italic> (4 February 2020), respiratory droplets, contact transmission, suspected aerosol transmission, and alimentary tract transmission are the main transmission routes. The 2019-nCoV poses significant threats to international health.</p><p id="p0030">In the early part of January 2020, the reported cases revealed that the elder population was at high risk for the 2019-nCoV, especially for severe cases. On 27 January 2020, the National Health Commission of China distributed the <italic>Diagnosis and Treatment Program of Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia</italic> (edition 4, January 27, 2020) and announced that all populations were susceptible to the 2019-nCoV, including children and infants. On 5 February 2020, a 30-hour-old infant was confirmed as having 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, the youngest patient so far, strongly suggesting the possibility of maternal&#x02013;infant vertical transmission. To date, some studies have revealed the epidemic pattern, clinical symptoms, and radiological features of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These studies mainly involved the adult cluster; however, research focusing on child clusters is still lacking, especially concerning the radiological features of infection in children.

Notably, one child (11.1%) was an asymptomatic carrier. All nine children had exposure to the epidemic area (Hubei Province, China) or a history of close contact with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV-infected patients within 2 weeks of onset, and all had familial aggregations of the infection. In terms of laboratory examinations, WBC counts were normal in all nine children, and lymphocytes decreased in two children, increased in two children, and remained normal in five children. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for secretions from cloacal swabs were positive in four of nine children (44.4%).

For the laboratory blood examinations, the WBC count results were all normal, and the lymphocyte ratio was decreased (2/9, 22.2%), increased (2/9, 22.2%), or remained normal (5/9, 55.5%). According to the <italic>Diagnosis and Treatment Program of Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia</italic> (5<sup>th</sup> edition, 4 February 2020), the WBC count usually remains normal or decreases, and the lymphocyte count decreases. The present data were somewhat different from this guideline and also showed that positive 2019-nCoV nucleic acid occurred in the cloacal swab (4/9, 44.4%) and urine sample (1/9, 11.1%), indicating a new potential transmission route. Therefore, 2019-nCoV patients' excrements should be well disposed to stop the suspected transmission routes.</p><p id="p0095">The present results showed that there were few diagnostic findings on radiography images, which showed insignificant findings such as disordered bilateral bronchovascular shadows and dense hilar shadows. The significant CT features included ground-glass opacities (4/9, 44.9%) and parenchymal bands (1/9, 11.1%). Ground-glass opacities were the most common CT features, with a ratio of 14&#x02013;77% in published studies.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>

<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Patchy, high-density shadows were the most common CT findings in five of the nine children with abnormalities. These CT findings were mainly located in the subpleural or peripheral part of the lungs. Consolidation lesions were absent. These features may be related to the fact that the pathophysiological change of the 2019-nCoV is relatively small and the transitionary process is relatively fast in children.</p><p id="p0100">These clinical features and CT findings in 2019-nCoV-infected children may overlap with those infected with other corona viruses: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MERS and SARS are the result of human&#x02013;animal interactions, with the capability of person-to-person spread. The preliminary pattern of 2019-nCoV suggests a zoonotic origin,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> but the exact origin and intermediate hosts have yet to be determined. Ground-glass opacities involving the peripheral lungs are the primary findings on CT. They were quite common findings on CT images; however, the consolidation sign, which was suggested as a marker of disease progression or more severe disease, was hardly shown in the CT images of 2019-nCoV-infected children.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The mortality of SARS-CoV has been reported as &#x0003e;10% and that of MERS-CoV at &#x0003e;35%.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> To date, the mortality of 2019-nCoV is reported at approximately 2.18% in mainland China.</p><p id="p0105">The present study has several limitations. First, the sample size was very small with only nine children from a single institution. Second, there were not enough follow-up CT examinations. Third, there was a lack of severe infection to compare findings between a severely infected child cluster and a mildly infected child cluster. Finally, more detailed patient information was unavailable at the time of analysis.</p><p id="p0110">In a way, this study also has some value. In Guangzhou city, medical resources including hospitals, physicians, numbers of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kits and other supportive conditions, such as medical protective equipment, were relatively sufficient. The ability and speed of the Guangzhou CDC to reconfirm the 2019-nCoV were sufficient. Therefore, suspected 2019-nCoV patients with Hubei exposure or a close contact history could be identified easily in Guangzhou city, especially in the child cluster. In Wuhan city, however, the number of confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV infected patients was large enough to restrict the vast majority of medical resources, resulting in many infected patients not being admitted to hospitals. Although there was exposure or a contact history, some mild patients and latent carriers would be missed, which leads to performance bias.</p><p id="p0115">In summary, this work reports an early investigation focusing on a child cluster with confirmed 2019-nCoV infections. The existence of ground-glass opacities, patchy shadows and parenchymal bands could help to identify viral pneumonia. Remarkably, many of the CT images of the 2019-nCoV-infected children showed no abnormalities. CT features alone are not sufficient to diagnose a 2019-nCoV infection, but help to evaluate the severity and process of infection. Clinical characteristics lack a typical pattern. Suspected 2019-nCoV-infected children with fever and/or cough and chest CT features, combined with a history of epidemical exposure/close contact, should not be misdiagnosed, especially when false-negative nucleic acid tests occur at an earlier stage.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="p0120">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>World Health Organization</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
