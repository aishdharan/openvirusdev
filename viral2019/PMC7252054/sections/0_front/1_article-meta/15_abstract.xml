  <p>To identify and summarise the common findings from 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections in children.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
  <p>The clinical characteristics and radiological findings (chest radiography and chest computed tomography [CT]) of nine children infected with the 2019-nCoV were reviewed in this retrospective case series.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>Among the children, six had fever (including two children with cough), one had only cough, one had a stuffy nose when initially diagnosed, and one was an asymptomatic carrier. Chest radiographs seemed mostly normal in six cases whereas increased and/or disordered bilateral bronchovascular shadows and dense hilar shadows were seen in three cases. Chest CT exhibited no obvious abnormal signs in four cases. Typical CT findings included patchy, peripheral ground-grass opacities, subpleural lamellar dense shadows, and parenchymal bands. Pleural effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, cavitation, and pleural thickening were absent.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
  <p>The clinical manifestations and radiological findings of the 2019-nCoV-infected children were mild and lacked a typical pattern.</p>
