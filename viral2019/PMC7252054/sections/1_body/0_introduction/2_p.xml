<p id="p0030">In the early part of January 2020, the reported cases revealed that the elder population was at high risk for the 2019-nCoV, especially for severe cases. On 27 January 2020, the National Health Commission of China distributed the 
 <italic>Diagnosis and Treatment Program of Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia</italic> (edition 4, January 27, 2020) and announced that all populations were susceptible to the 2019-nCoV, including children and infants. On 5 February 2020, a 30-hour-old infant was confirmed as having 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, the youngest patient so far, strongly suggesting the possibility of maternalâ€“infant vertical transmission. To date, some studies have revealed the epidemic pattern, clinical symptoms, and radiological features of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.

Therefore, it is important to understand the clinical pattern of child clusters of 2019-nCoV infection.
