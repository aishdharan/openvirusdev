<p id="p0055">Chest volume computed tomography (CT) was performed using a 64-section spiral CT system (Aquilion TSX-101A, Toshiba Medical System, Japan). The scanning range was from the superior aperture of the thorax to the costophrenic angle. The parameters were as follows: 120 kV tube voltage, 50â€“70 mA tube current 0.5 s/rot bulb rotation speed, and 0.2 mm slice thickness. All examinations were performed with the child in the supine position during end-inspiration without intravenous contrast medium. Palliative administration of oral 10% chloral hydrate at a concentration of 0.5 ml/kg body weight was performed when the children were too young or uncooperative.</p>
