<p id="p0080">Among the nine children's CT images, the images from four cases (44.4%) showed no significant abnormal signs. The CT images of four children (44.4%) showed multiple fan-shaped/oval ground-glass opacities mainly located in the subpleural area of both lungs, with a central thickened vascular shadow and slightly thickened interlobular septa in one case (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> ). These ground-glass opacities were usually infiltrating several lobes but not the whole lung, with blurred edges and some “halo signs” (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> a). There were also some parenchymal bands (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> ). Other abnormalities, such as mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, pleural thickening, cavitation, calcification, and bronchiectasis, were absent in the above cases. Two children had follow-up chest CT imaging during the study period. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>b, the lesions resolved, with a density reduction in the central area, in the same location in the inferior lobe in the right lung 4 days after the last scan. The detailed CT image features for each child are listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.
