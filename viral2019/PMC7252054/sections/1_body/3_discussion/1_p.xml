<p id="p0085">The present study describes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection data for nine children who were transferred to the children's hospital from other hospitals across Guangzhou Province, mainly Guangzhou city. Generally, the clinical symptoms were mild in all nine children compared to the clinical symptoms of the adult cluster.

 </xref> No child was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The radiography and CT image features were also atypical. There were few significant diagnostic findings on the radiographs. CT image features varied, and included ground-glass opacities (4/9, 44.4%) and parenchymal bands (1/9, 11.1%). Although chest volume CT is a key component of the diagnostic work-up for patients with suspected infection, CT images showed no diagnostic features in four of the nine children in the present study. Therefore, epidemic area (Hubei Province, China) exposure and/or a confirmed or suspected history of close contact with a 2019-nCoV-infected patient were important clues for diagnosis in this child cluster.
