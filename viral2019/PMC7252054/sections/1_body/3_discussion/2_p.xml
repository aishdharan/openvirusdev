<p id="p0090">In the present study, the mean age of the children was 7.8 years and the youngest infected child was 2-months old. The children's symptoms included fever (6/9, 66.7%), cough (3/9, 33.3%), stuffy nose (1/9, 11.1%), and rhinorrhoea (1/9, 11.1%), with no shortness of breath, myalgia, fatigue, confusion, chest pain, headache, or sore throat. Case 1 (a 13-year-old boy) had no symptoms. According to their exposure and/or close contact history, all nine children underwent the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test using the secretions from cloacal swabs and were confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection. For the laboratory blood examinations, the WBC count results were all normal, and the lymphocyte ratio was decreased (2/9, 22.2%), increased (2/9, 22.2%), or remained normal (5/9, 55.5%). According to the 
 <italic>Diagnosis and Treatment Program of Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia</italic> (5
 <sup>th</sup> edition, 4 February 2020), the WBC count usually remains normal or decreases, and the lymphocyte count decreases. The present data were somewhat different from this guideline and also showed that positive 2019-nCoV nucleic acid occurred in the cloacal swab (4/9, 44.4%) and urine sample (1/9, 11.1%), indicating a new potential transmission route. Therefore, 2019-nCoV patients' excrements should be well disposed to stop the suspected transmission routes.
