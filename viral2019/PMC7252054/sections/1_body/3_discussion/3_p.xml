<p id="p0095">The present results showed that there were few diagnostic findings on radiography images, which showed insignificant findings such as disordered bilateral bronchovascular shadows and dense hilar shadows. The significant CT features included ground-glass opacities (4/9, 44.9%) and parenchymal bands (1/9, 11.1%). Ground-glass opacities were the most common CT features, with a ratio of 14â€“77% in published studies.

 </xref> Patchy, high-density shadows were the most common CT findings in five of the nine children with abnormalities. These CT findings were mainly located in the subpleural or peripheral part of the lungs. Consolidation lesions were absent. These features may be related to the fact that the pathophysiological change of the 2019-nCoV is relatively small and the transitionary process is relatively fast in children.
