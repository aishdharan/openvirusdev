<p id="p0105">The present study has several limitations. First, the sample size was very small with only nine children from a single institution. Second, there were not enough follow-up CT examinations. Third, there was a lack of severe infection to compare findings between a severely infected child cluster and a mildly infected child cluster. Finally, more detailed patient information was unavailable at the time of analysis.</p>
