<p id="p0110">In a way, this study also has some value. In Guangzhou city, medical resources including hospitals, physicians, numbers of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kits and other supportive conditions, such as medical protective equipment, were relatively sufficient. The ability and speed of the Guangzhou CDC to reconfirm the 2019-nCoV were sufficient. Therefore, suspected 2019-nCoV patients with Hubei exposure or a close contact history could be identified easily in Guangzhou city, especially in the child cluster. In Wuhan city, however, the number of confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV infected patients was large enough to restrict the vast majority of medical resources, resulting in many infected patients not being admitted to hospitals. Although there was exposure or a contact history, some mild patients and latent carriers would be missed, which leads to performance bias.</p>
