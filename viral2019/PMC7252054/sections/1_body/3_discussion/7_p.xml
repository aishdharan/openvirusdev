<p id="p0115">In summary, this work reports an early investigation focusing on a child cluster with confirmed 2019-nCoV infections. The existence of ground-glass opacities, patchy shadows and parenchymal bands could help to identify viral pneumonia. Remarkably, many of the CT images of the 2019-nCoV-infected children showed no abnormalities. CT features alone are not sufficient to diagnose a 2019-nCoV infection, but help to evaluate the severity and process of infection. Clinical characteristics lack a typical pattern. Suspected 2019-nCoV-infected children with fever and/or cough and chest CT features, combined with a history of epidemical exposure/close contact, should not be misdiagnosed, especially when false-negative nucleic acid tests occur at an earlier stage.</p>
