  <p>A 3-year-old male patient with a history of close contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV-infected patient, who presented with a stuffy nose and rhinorrhoea, received interferon-alpha atomising therapy in the isolation unit. (a) Axial unenhanced CT image (scanned on 5 February 2020) shows multiple mixed patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities, with a central thickened vascular shadow and a blurred edge, in the subpleural area of the inferior lobe in the right lung. (b) The CT image (scanned on 9 February 2020) indicates that the lesions resolved, with density reduction in the central area, in the same location in the inferior lobe in the right lung.</p>
