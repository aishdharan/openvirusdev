<p>Crude case fatality rates (CFR) of 3.7% were reported for mainland China. If milder cases are incorporated into that calculation, CFR were reduced to 1.4% for COVID‐19 patients, which is still substantially higher than that of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. CFR showed a strong age dependency, with 6.4% for &gt; 60‐year‐old, and 13.4% for &gt; 80‐year‐old patients. Time from onset of symptoms to death was 19 days (Verity

Non‐survivors differed from survivors for comorbidity, specifically coronary heart disease (24 vs. 1%), hypertension (48% vs. 23%) and diabetes. An increased blood chemistry parameter of thrombosis (d‐dimer) was highly correlated with death. Sepsis was a common complication, but patients showed no bacterial co‐pathogen at admission (Zhou
