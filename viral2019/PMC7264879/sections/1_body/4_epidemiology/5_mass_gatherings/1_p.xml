<p>Mass movement, as in the cases of the Chinese and the Iranian New Year celebrations, is a motor of epidemic spread.

 <sup>2</sup>/child) compared to offices (18 m
 <sup>2</sup>/person) and homes (36 m
 <sup>2</sup>/person) (US data). School closure can, however, also increase mortality via the immobilization of healthcare personnel without alternate child care available (Bayham and Fenichel,
