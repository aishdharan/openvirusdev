<p>Due to a proof‐reading viral enzyme, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is low for the standards of an RNA virus. Now SARS‐CoV‐2 strains start to differentiate into two subtypes, S and L, with L being newer and now more frequent. There is no indication that this shift is linked to changes in biological properties. SARS‐CoV‐2 is expected to accumulate 1–2 mutation per month during epidemic circulation (Kupferschmidt,

 <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The few sequence differences can be used for epidemiological analysis. For example, the first Italian COVID‐19 patient in Rome showed a virus sequence closely related to that of a Chinese tourist to Italy while a patient from Lombardy was most closely related to a virus isolated in Munich, suggestive of multiple introduction of SARS‐CoV‐2 into Italy (Giovanetti 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2020b</xref>). This study reported another important observation: COVID‐19 patients, when compared with bacterial pneumonia cases, lacked commensal bacteria in the lungs and showed nearly exclusively viral RNA. This indicates massive viral replication in the lung and the absence of a bacterial co‐pathogen.
