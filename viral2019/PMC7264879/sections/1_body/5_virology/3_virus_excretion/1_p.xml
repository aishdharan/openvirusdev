<p>Viral RNA peaked 3 days after symptom onset and decreased over the next 2 weeks. Viral load was higher in the nose than in the throat (Zou

Obtaining sputum and bronchoscopy samples, which are the most sensitive test material, is linked with substantial infection risk for the physician (Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2020a</xref>). At admission, mild cases showed a 60‐fold lower respiratory viral load than in severe cases, and they also showed an earlier viral clearance (Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Patients from Hong Kong were followed for viral load in self‐collected saliva. Titres were high directly after symptom onset, declined subsequently, but could remain positive for 3 weeks. Titres were higher in older patients, but did not correlate with disease severity. Viruses did not accumulate mutations (To

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Also, Chinese patients excreted the virus in the stool for up to 12 days; a quarter of the stool samples tested for the virus remained positive, when the respiratory sample had already become negative. Virus replication apparently occurred in the gut, since the virus receptor is also expressed on gut epithelia (Xiao 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,
