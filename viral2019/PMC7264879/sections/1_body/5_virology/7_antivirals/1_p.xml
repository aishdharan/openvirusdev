<p>Two approaches, which were already used against SARS‐CoV, were also tested against SARS‐CoV‐2. A possible drug target is the protease of SARS‐CoV‐2, which cleaves the polyprotein translated from the viral RNA genome into the mature viral proteins. Medicinal chemists modified a ketoamide inhibitor, active against SARS and MERS viruses such that it also inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2 at micromolar concentrations, as demonstrated by
