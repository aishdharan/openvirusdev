<p id="Par1">In December 2019, China reported the emergence of a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. By 7 January 2020, the etiology of the pneumonia was attributed to a virus of the coronavirus family, and later on the disease was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020 by the WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The symptoms of COVID-19 appear after an average incubation period of 5.2 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The median period from the onset of the disease to death is 14 days (range 6 to 41) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Transmission of the virus is human to human through direct contact, or air droplets from infected persons spread by coughing or sneezing. The infection droplets can also contaminate surfaces, and the virus can remain infectious for several days in the environment, providing a reservoir for the infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The majority of infections go into remission without intervention, while approximately 15% will require hospitalization, with approximately 5% of these requiring intensive care [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Unmitigated spread of COVID-19 creates pressure on health systems, and diverts resources that could have otherwise been better utilized for other health conditions. Sub-Saharan Africa health systems are already strained and are characterized by poor health outcomes with high mortality rates linked to the triple burden of disease (HIV, tuberculosis, and non-communicable diseases) and out of pocket healthcare.
