<p id="Par3">Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is home to over one billion people, with a current growth rate of 2.3% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. By the end of 2020, it is estimated that the SSA region will have an approximate population of 1.1 billion and it will account for most of the world’s population growth in the coming decades, whilst other regions’ populations will be declining [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, with this growing population, the region has persisted as the epicenter of the HIV epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are over 26 million PLWH in Sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It was estimated that 1.7 million new HIV infections occurred globally during the year 2018, which translates to 5000 new infections per day. Overall, 61% of these new infections occurred in SSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Key populations and their sexual partners contributed approximately 25% of the new infections in the Eastern and Southern regions of Africa, whilst contributing 64% of the new infections in the Western and Central African regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the Eastern and Southern region of Africa, 85% of PLWH knew their status, whilst 67% of those were on treatment and 58% of those on treatment had viral suppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the Western and Central African region, 64% of PLWH knew their status, 79% were accessing treatment, and 76% had viral suppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Approximately 310,000 people died due to HIV/AIDS in 2018 in East and Southern Africa, whilst 280,000 died in West and Central Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given the HIV disease burden in SSA, it is critical that the region continues to implement control efforts, even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Interventions that reach and test people earlier and retest persons with ongoing HIV risk have benefits not only for reducing HIV morbidity and mortality, but in interrupting and preventing HIV transmission [
