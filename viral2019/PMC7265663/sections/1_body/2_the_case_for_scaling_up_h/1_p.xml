 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This goal can only be achieved if at least 90% of the HIV infected population is diagnosed and linked to care. Historically, community-based testing has targeted volunteers, who were mostly women, to get tested. Men and youth are not as forthcoming with regards to testing, and are disproportionately contributing to testing gaps [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While interventions have been in place to improve testing rates among these priority populations, confinement due to natural disasters in the Unites States [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] have been shown to hinder uptake of HIV testing services. The current COVID-19 crisis is even more complicated, as there are multifaceted barriers to facility-based HIV testing, including but not limited to a lack of access due to the closure of facilities, shortage of staff due to illness, and reluctance by individuals to attend clinics due to fear of being exposed to SARS-COV 2 at health facilities [
