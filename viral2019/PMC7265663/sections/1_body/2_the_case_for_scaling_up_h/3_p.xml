 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. HIVST offers a means to fast track pre-screening and triaging out of those who self-test negative. HIVST can close the testing gap, as it can increase testing coverage and frequency. This allows the health system to focus only on those who require further assistance with respect to counselling, confirmation testing, and ART initiation. HIVST has the added benefit of reducing the number of health center visits during the period of quarantine and social distancing, in order to curb viral transmission. The COVID-19 pandemic has already placed a strain on the health system, and expansion of the HIVST approach will ease the strain and help to prevent overwhelming of facilities with HIV testing. Multiple studies conducted in the Sub-Saharan Africa region have already revealed high acceptance across individuals of various demographics [
