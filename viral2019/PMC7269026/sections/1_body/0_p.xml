<p>As of 14 February 2020, an outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has resulted in 66,492 confirmed cases across mainland China [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>]. The majority of early domestic cases in other cities in China as well as international cases were associated with Wuhan [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–5</xref>]. Every year, billions of people travel across the country during the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) holiday (celebrated from 10 January to 18 February for the year 2020) [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Wuhan is a transportation hub in central China with a population of 11 million [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and an estimated five million people had already left the city as of 26 January 2020 [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The huge volume of population movement during the early stage of the epidemic, and the central role of transportation for Wuhan, facilitated the spread of the disease across China. Wuhan suspended all public transport in and out of the city on 23 January 2020 [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. By 25 January, the first day of the Lunar New Year, thirty provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China have activated the highest level (Level-I) alert and response of public health emergency [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, it is unclear to what degree Wuhan travel ban mitigated the epidemic size early on in other cities in China.
