<p>Based on the same assumption of the effect of population movement on the imported cases, cities with most imported risk are cities with the most population influx from high risk cities after the holiday (Figure S3A and Table S4). Overall, for the cities with positive population net reflux, we would expect a 61% (48%–92%) [30,490 (24,015–46,074) cases] increase of overall cumulative cases under the scenario without any restrictions on returning for work (Figure S3B and Table S5) and an 11% (8%–16%) [5275 (4188–7895) cases] increase of overall cumulative cases under the scenario with the travel ban for Hubei still in place (Figure S3C and Table S6).</p>
