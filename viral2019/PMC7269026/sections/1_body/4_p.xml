<p>Evaluating the impact of population movement on the spread of the new emerging 2019-nCoV virus is of crucial importance for targeted and precise public health response and control [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In summary, based on the simple model for imported cases, we studied the contribution of transportation and evaluated the consequences for different scenarios of travel bans and work resumption. Our findings suggest that population movement makes substantial contribution to the disease spread in the early stage of the outbreak and travel bans were effective but would have been more helpful if implemented earlier. Cities that are labor-intensive (e.g. Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Beijing) need to take more strong measures to prevent potential rebound of 2019-nCoV outbreak incurred by population reflux. Beyond population movement restriction studied here, there are other factors that may contribute to the overall prevention and control of the epidemic, like the timely medical resources, socioeconomical factors and even climate factors etc., and should be systematically investigated in the future.
