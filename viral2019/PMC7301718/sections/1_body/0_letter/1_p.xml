<p>A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged to cause a major outbreak of severe pneumonia in humans in China and has spread to over 100 other countries [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As of April 6th 2020, 1,210,956 cases with 67,594 deaths (5.6% case fatality rate) had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). The major transmission routes are believed to be exposure to virus-containing droplets or contaminated fomites [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although viral RNA can be detected in multiple organs in COVID-19 patients, infectious SARS-CoV-2 has only been isolated from respiratory specimens [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since the viral receptor, angiotensin-convertase-2 (ACE2) protein, is expressed in the kidney, the testis and the bladder [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and viral RNA has been detected in the sink and toilet of COVID-19 patients, the virus may be secreted through the urinary system [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, it is currently unclear if infectious virus is secreted in urine.
