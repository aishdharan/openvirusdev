<p>RT–PCR positive urine specimens (Ct 34) from day 12 p.i. was serially diluted in infection media and inoculated onto Vero E6 cells. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were clearly observed after 3 days (

Cell culture supernatant was negatively stained and visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Spherical-shaped particles with distinct surface projections, resembling spikes, that were consistent with SARS-CoV-2 virions as published previously (

In order to prove that the isolated virus was infectious to susceptible cells, fresh Vero E6 cells was inoculated with the virus and stained in an immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using serum obtained from the patient and from a healthy donor. Results showed positive fluorescence with patient’s serum but not with healthy control serum (
