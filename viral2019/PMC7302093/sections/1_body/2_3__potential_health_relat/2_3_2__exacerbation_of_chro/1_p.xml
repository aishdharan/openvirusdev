<p>Some CP patients may experience exacerbation of symptoms resulting from COVID-19 due to both public health and personal issues. Regular medical care may be compromised during lockdown and the ensuing months.

 </sup> Routine clinics may be less accessible or closed, healthcare professionals may be diverted to COVID-19-related activities, and waiting times may be prolonged, especially for medical illnesses such as CP that many consider nonurgent. Patients may be less able or willing to travel for care, or may be fearful of exposure to infection in a public or medical setting. There may be delays in timely access to medications due to reduced prescribing, as well as to pain management procedures considered to be of lesser importance than the care of patients with more urgent illnesses. Reduced clinical encounters with interdisciplinary healthcare team members (eg, physiotherapists, psychologists, and self-help groups) can have adverse consequences. Access to medications may be reduced due to logistical factors or true drug shortages when analgesic medications are diverted to emergency care causing some to turn to alcohol or nonmedically prescribed substances as a desperate measure to relieve poorly managed pain. The rapid evolution of telehealth presents new challenges for clinical care, especially for those not fully comfortable with or without access to digital technology. The economic impact on public health is evident for working patients who may have lost jobs or health insurance and must contend with financial insecurity or even poverty. Another factor to consider is reduced health-related physical activities, which are a vital management strategy for CP, that result from social distancing and isolation, and closure of group activity programs such as gyms and pools.

 </sup> Patients may have a heightened awareness of physical symptoms accompanied by fear that these symptoms are an indication of infection. These numerous and persistent stressors may exacerbate pain, even in the absence of viral illness.
