<p>Given these factors, common wisdom might suggest that catastrophic and stressful events such as COVID-19 will inevitably lead to an exacerbation of CP. However, 2 studies performed in the United States just before and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks indicate that not all psychological stressors will trigger or exacerbate CP. Pain complaints and other somatic symptoms did not change among residents of New York and New Jersey who had been surveyed before and after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.

 </sup> Daily “hassles” and personally relevant stressors seem to be more likely to cause symptoms than major catastrophic events that do not personally impact the individual.
