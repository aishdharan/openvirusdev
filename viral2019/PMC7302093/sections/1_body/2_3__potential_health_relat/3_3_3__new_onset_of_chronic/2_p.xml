<p>Numerous factors contribute to high stress levels across geographic boundaries. Nearly everyone is exposed to relentless media coverage and conflicting messages, and concerns about contracting SARS-CoV2, routine medical care, family, jobs, and economic issues are pervasive. Those with an underlying mental health disorder are at particular risk for exacerbation. Further stressors relate to social distancing, isolation and quarantine, and in some, grieving a death without the usual social support system. Persistent and extreme stress can lead to severe mental health consequences including an increased suicide rate. There is preliminary evidence that anxiety and depression (16%-28%), self-reported stress (8%), and sleep disturbances are common reactions to this pandemic.
