 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus far, no effective therapy is available and, therefore, contact precautions, hygiene measures, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine are the methods of choice to control the spread of this infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, epidemics with respiratory virus such as not only influenza but also human corona viruses are prevalent in the Northern hemisphere over several months during the cold season and then disappear whereas influenza remains prevalent in tropical regions throughout the whole year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The reasons for this decline are still incompletely understood. We thus questioned whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic will be in part slowed down by the change from the cold to the warm seasons in the Northern hemisphere.
