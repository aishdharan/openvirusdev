<p id="Par3">To assess local epidemics from respiratory infections over the course of a season, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 15,336 patients (8907 women and 6429 men) who visited a primary care internal medicine practice in Innsbruck, Austria, between July 1, 1999, and March 15, 2020. Overall, our dataset included 145,740 diagnoses, of which 16,317 are assigned to acute respiratory diseases according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10;

In particular, we included viral and bacterial infections classified into diagnostic groups A and B as well as infectious diseases of the respiratory tract of groups J (pulmonology), H (ear, nose and throat) and R (general symptoms consistent with infections such as dyspnea or fatigue). Based on this data, we first counted the number of patients who sought medical help because of serious respiratory infections. Second, we related these counts to the total number of diagnoses within each month to obtain the share of viral infections. In the denominator of this ratio, we excluded malignancies (group C), neoplasia (D), diabetes mellitus 2 (E-11.9), arterial hypertension (I-10) and ischemic heart diseases (I-20). As the mentioned practice was sometimes closed due to holiday breaks, the share of viral infections might provide a more suitable figure on seasonal patterns than the simple count measure.
