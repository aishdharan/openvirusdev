<p>Chest computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) showed extensive subpleural and para-mediastinal cystic changes, subpleural ground-glass changes bilaterally, most prominent in the upper lobes with relative sparing of the lung bases; consistent with PJP. Incidental interstitial lung fibrosis and paraseptal emphysema was also reported.
