<p>We report the first case of 
 <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> and SARS-CoV-2 detection in an individual with well controlled HIV. At the time of writing, only one other HIV/COVID-19 coinfection case has been published, with limited details of the individual's HIV status [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and an European regional database of HIV/COVID-19 cases is currently under way [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We recommend further epidemiological data from HIV/COVID-19 cases to be collected and reported to understand the relationship between COVID-19, HIV, and antiretroviral therapy.
