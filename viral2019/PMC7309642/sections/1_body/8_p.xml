<p>Sensitivity of RT-PCR from throat swabs to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been reported as 95% [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, retrospective studies comparing RT-PCR against combined clinical and radiographic criteria to diagnose COVID-19 in an epidemic setting reported lower sensitivities of RT-PCR at 70–80% [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Lower detection rates are associated with time from symptom onset, dropping from 100% to 40% if taken after day 5 of symptoms [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Retrospective testing of this patient's-induced sputum, taken within 26 h of the negative throat swab, confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Lower respiratory samples by induced sputum may aid diagnosis in the presence of negative upper respiratory samples [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
