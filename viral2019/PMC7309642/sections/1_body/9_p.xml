<p>The detection of 
 <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> DNA in the induced sputum and an initial negative SARS-CoV-2 result in the presence of characteristic features of PJP formed the basis of the PJP diagnosis. The significance of detected 
 <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> DNA using PCR alone remains uncertain and may represent colonization of the respiratory tract. Immunofluorescence microscopy was not available in this case. The prevalence of detectable 
 <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> DNA in healthy immunocompetent adults has been reported between 0% and 20% [
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, in 100% of lung autopsy samples from immunocompetent individuals with detectable 
 <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> DNA, detailed immunofluorescence microscopy revealed both cyst and trofozoite forms suggestive of actively replicating 
 <italic>P. jirovecii</italic>[
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], suggesting mild PJP infection may be present even in immunocompetent adults with detectable 
 <italic>P. jirovecii</italic>.
