<p>The speed by which viral genomic sequences were made publicly available during the COVID-19 pandemic also demonstrates the fast pace of data sharing during the period. As early as December 31, 2019, 19 genomic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were already available through the GISAID database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">gisaid.org</ext-link>), which now has over 40,000 viral genome sequences shared by laboratories around the globe. As a comparison, during the Ebola virus outbreak, it took nearly 3 years for the number of sequenced viral genomes to reach 1,500 sequences (

The early availability of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences contributed to the rapid development of the gold standard molecular diagnostic assays for COVID-19, based on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), made available by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), still in early 2020 (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Additionally, it also contributed to the development of streamlined protocols for complete viral genome sequencing and analysis (
