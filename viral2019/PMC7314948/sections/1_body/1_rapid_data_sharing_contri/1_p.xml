<p>A good example demonstrating how rapid data sharing contributed to the development of diagnostics during the COVID-19 pandemic is shown by the first RT-qPCR assay design developed by researchers from the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin Institute of Virology in Germany (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The first SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequence was made publicly available for immediate public health support as soon as 10 days after official reporting of the early cases of atypical pneumonia in China to the WHO. Only 3 days later (on January 13, 2020), the first RT-qPCR assay was made available to the international community. A few days later, positive controls were already available through the European Virus Archive (EVAg) repository (

Soon after, on February 4, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to the CDC's 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. It did not take long for new studies describing SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics in different samples to be published for the different genomic targets (N, E, and RdRP), and this contributed to improvements in diagnostic protocols early in the epidemic. Compared to Zika virus epidemic, it was only nearly 1 year after first case descriptions in Brazil that the US FDA issued an EUA for the Trioplex assay on March 17, 2016.
