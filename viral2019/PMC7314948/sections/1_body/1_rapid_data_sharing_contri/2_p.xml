<p>The widespread adoption of preprint servers (such as

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">biorxiv.org</ext-link>) for sharing research data before peer review has also allowed rapid publication of studies evaluating the performances of different diagnostic technologies and has contributed to a clearer understanding of emerging technologies that will potentially aid in the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 in the near future (

Now, COVID-19 related preprint publications have permitted foreseeing emerging roles for technologies based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and CRISPR-based diagnostics, as these technologies are indeed appearing now in peer-reviewed publications and starting to reach commercial applications. In an interesting recent development, for example, isothermal amplification by reverse-transcription (RT)-LAMP was combined with specific CRISPR/Cas12 detection of SARS-CoV-2 amplified targets and with visual readout by lateral flow assay (
