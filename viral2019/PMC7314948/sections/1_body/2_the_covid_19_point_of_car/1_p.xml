<p>Now, we can easily follow the development of new COVID-19 diagnostic technology into commercial products due to data sharing initiatives, such as the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND;

From data made available on over 590 COVID-19 diagnostic tests (as of April 24, 2020), we can have a clear view of the point-of-care (PoC) diagnostic technology landscape (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the numbers of commercially manufactured COVID-19 molecular tests and immunoassays are similar, there is clearly a higher proportion of decentralized tests that are based on immunoassays when compared to molecular methods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is probably due to the technological maturity of colloidal-gold immunochromatographic assays. Conversely, the greater number of lab-based commercial molecular tests for COVID-19 is due to the high number of companies offering RT-qPCR based kits (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnostics), although this does not necessarily mean that these tests are commercially available in Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, novel EUAs for COVID-19 tests are being granted in a continuous basis by regulatory agencies worldwide, including the US FDA (
