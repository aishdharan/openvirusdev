<p>As of late April 2020, the WHO still did not recommend the use of PoC rapid immunodiagnostic tests (RDTs) for patient care and public health decision-making in the COVID-19 context (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, most of the commercially available tests to date are in fact based on lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) technologies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigens or human IgM/IgG antibodies (

Regarding PoC or near-PoC commercially manufactured molecular tests, two technological strategies are clear: (i) methods that provide simplified workflows for nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs); and (ii) methods based on isothermal amplification by LAMP. In the former category, tried-and-tested diagnostic platforms with simplified sample-to-results workflows have already been introduced by major companies, such as the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test (Cepheid) and the ID Now COVID-19 assay (Abbott Diagnostics).
