 <caption> The COVID-19 diagnostic technology landscape. (A) A (non-exhaustive) list of the current and emerging technologies for laboratory-based or decentralized (near or at the point-of-care) COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, such as chest computed tomography, are discussed elsewhere ( 6, 7, 11). *Disambiguation: despite being frequently used in the COVID-19 context, the abbreviation RT-PCR is more appropriate to the traditional method of reverse-transcription PCR. For real-time (quantitative) reverse-transcription PCR, such as in SARS-CoV-2 detection, it is more appropriate to use RT-qPCR or rtRT-PCR. FDA EUA, US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization (EUA); PoC, point-of-care; NAT, nucleic acid test. (B) Categories of commercially manufactured COVID-19 diagnostic tests, as of late Apr 2020. (C) Regulatory status of the available tests. EUA, Emergency Use Authorization; CE-IVD, Conformité Européenne (EU certification)- in vitro diagnostics; RUO, research use only. (D) Major technologies used in current point-of-care diagnostic tests for COVID-19. </caption>
