  <p>The COVID-19 diagnostic technology landscape. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A (non-exhaustive) list of the current and emerging technologies for laboratory-based or decentralized (near or at the point-of-care) COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, such as chest computed tomography, are discussed elsewhere (

For real-time (quantitative) reverse-transcription PCR, such as in SARS-CoV-2 detection, it is more appropriate to use RT-qPCR or rtRT-PCR. FDA EUA, US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization (EUA); PoC, point-of-care; NAT, nucleic acid test. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Categories of commercially manufactured COVID-19 diagnostic tests, as of late Apr 2020. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Regulatory status of the available tests. EUA, Emergency Use Authorization; CE-IVD, Conformité Européenne (EU certification)-
   <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnostics; RUO, research use only. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Major technologies used in current point-of-care diagnostic tests for COVID-19.
