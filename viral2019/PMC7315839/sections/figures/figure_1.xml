  <p>MIP 3D imaging, before chemotherapy (
   <bold>A</bold>) and after the fourth cycle (
   <bold>B</bold>). We have incidentally diagnosed a pulmonary infection in an asymptomatic 27-year-old woman on a reevaluation PET/CT after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Stage IIIE B Hodgkin lymphoma was diagnosed in November 2019. Initially, the disease extended to pelvic, retroperitoneal, celiac, mediastinal, internal mammary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes, as well as to the spleen and local extension to the pericardium and left lung. Dose-escalated BEACOPP chemotherapy was initiated on December 5, 2019.

   </sup> PET/CT showed a metabolic complete remission after 2 cycles. Cycle 4 was started on March 3, 2020, and ended on March 10, 2020. A reevaluation PET/CT was performed on March 18, 2020. CT scan showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and subpleural pseudonodular mixed ground-glass and consolidative lesions. The MIP image showed several areas of FDG avidity predominantly in the lower base of the left lung. Bone marrow avidity is related most likely to recovery from aplasia under filgrastim administration.
