<p>We performed next-generation sequencing and viral metagenomic survey in plasma samples aiming to identify viruses potentially associated with adverse effects reported by blood donors up to 14 days after donation (fever, exanthema, headache, myalgia, diarrhea, jaundice, sore throat, cough, conjunctivitis), which is defined as postdonation information. Such information generally results in disposal of the donated blood to prevent transfusion transmission of not routinely tested infectious agents.</p>
