<p>In 1 (4%) of 28 blood donations, we identified RNA fragments of influenza A. The donor, a 25-year-old woman, donated blood on January 28, 2019, after an interview in which she was approved as eligible for blood donation. Three days later (January 30) she reported low-grade fever, cough, and coryza to the blood center. The blood donation positive for influenza A was processed into packed red cells, plasma, and platelets, but because of the timely postdonation information report, all hemoderivatives were discarded. Because of the low severity of the reported symptoms, which were not directly related to the blood donation procedure, the donor was not followed up.</p>
