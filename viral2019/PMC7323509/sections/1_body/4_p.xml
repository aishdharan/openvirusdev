<p>The viral metagenomic pipeline identified a 756-bp fragment of polymerase base (PB) 2 gene of influenza A, but targeted assembly using Burrow-Wheeler Aligner version 0.6 (

We directly confirmed influenza A using multisegment reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) as described previously (

The influenza A in the donated blood was phylogenetically determined to belong to H3N2 type (
