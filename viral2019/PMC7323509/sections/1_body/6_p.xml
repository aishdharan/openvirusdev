<p>Although our report is based on a single blood donation, the finding raises the theoretical possibility of transmission of influenza by blood transfusion, which may be of great concern for transfusion services during seasonal influenza outbreaks or pandemics. Unfortunately, we could not confirm whether the detected influenza virus H3N2 remained infectious in the donated plasma. Nevertheless, identification of influenza RNA is especially important because a substantial proportion of persons who receive blood transfusions may have permanent or transient immune dysfunction, which might lead to unfavorable clinical outcome if transfusion-acquired influenza infection occurs. The transmission of influenza by transfusion remains understudied, and more detailed surveys are needed, including assessment of influenza viremia in blood donors during seasonal outbreaks and confirmation of cell-associated peripheral blood circulation of influenza subtypes.</p>
