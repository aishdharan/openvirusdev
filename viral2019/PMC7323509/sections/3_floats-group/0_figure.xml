  <p>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of hemagglutinin (A) and neuraminidase (B) of influenza A(H3N2) virus detected in blood donation, Brazil. A total of 264 hemagglutinin and 419 neuraminidase sequences from seasonal strains circulating during 2011â€“2019 and available in GISAID (

Green indicates the H3N2 strain obtained from blood donor from Ribeirao Preto; diamonds at each node indicate statistical support along branches defined as ultrafast bootstrapping &gt;90% (of 10,000 replicates). The cluster where the donor strain obtained from Ribeirao Preto is located is shown in detail at bottom. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site.
