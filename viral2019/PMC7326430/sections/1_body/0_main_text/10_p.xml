However, many tractable opportunities remain to be exploited for closing the various loopholes in intervention coverage and effectiveness that allow residual transmission to persist through essential workers, goods and services of all kinds (

It is also encouraging that viral outbreaks of Ebola in 2014 and 2018, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 all threated to become larger pandemics but were successfully contained and eliminated. However, the most convincing reason to be optimistic about SARS-CoV-2 is that several countries in Asia and the Pacific that have already crushed their epidemic curves are well on the way to elimination and exclusion endpoints.
