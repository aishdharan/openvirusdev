<p id="p0015">However, different countries appear to be applying these behavioural interventions to achieve quite distinct targets for their epidemic trajectories (

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Fineberg, 2020</xref>) of their epidemic trajectories, to promptly eliminate SARS-CoV-2 transmission at national level, include China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia. In stark contrast, the United States and many hard-hit European countries, like Ireland, Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom, currently appear content to merely 
 <italic>flatten the curve</italic> of their epidemic trajectories so that transmission persists at rates their critical care services can cope with. Here I present a simple set of arithmetic modelling analyses that explain why preferable 
 <italic>crush the curve</italic> strategies, to eliminate transmission within months, would require only a modest amount of additional containment effort relative to the tipping point targeted by 
 <italic>flatten the curve</italic> strategies, which allow epidemics to persist at supposedly steady, manageable levels for years, decades or even indefinitely (
