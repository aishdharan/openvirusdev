<p id="p0020">Much can be learned by simply examining the targets for these two alternative strategies, relative to the starting point before interventions were introduced, expressed in terms of the reproductive number of the virus (
 <italic>R</italic>) or number of new infections arising from any initial infection over its full duration. An epidemic curve which has been exactly flattened, so that the rate of incidence of new infections remains constant (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> = 1.0), represents the tipping point in efforts to contain SARS-CoV-2. Once the reproductive number has been pushed below this critical threshold, even modest further reductions achieve a snowball effect that crushes the epidemic curve by progressively accelerating progress towards elimination of local transmission (
