<p id="p0030">While this is a considerable achievement, it begs the question why these countries would not build upon their successes by pushing even just a little further past this crucial tipping point? Why not just further fine-tune their epidemic responses to steepen the downslope they now find themselves on and then pursue the sequential goals of elimination and exclusion? Even just a further 10% reduction of transmission may be reasonably expected to result in an overall transmission reduction of 85% and an epidemic that would contract by 40% (
