<p id="p0040">Transmission from one individual to another requires exposure behaviours by two people who interact through direct contact or through shared spaces, surfaces and objects. Transmission rate is therefore proportional to the product of their individual exposure behaviour rates, which in turn depends on limitations of intervention coverage and effectiveness once containment measures are introduced. Correspondingly, the reproductive rate achieved by such control measures may be calculated as a simple squared function of the gap in the population mean effective protective coverage (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D), so thresholds for flattening or crushing the epidemic curve may be achieved more readily than would otherwise be envisaged (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E and F). When intervention effectiveness is expressed as the mean proportional reduction of individual exposure behaviours, a steady-state flattened curve is achieved at an effective protective coverage of only 50% (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D, E and F). Even very modest further reductions beyond this threshold result in remarkably steep expected downslopes for epidemic contraction (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E and F). For example, incidence rates are expected to drop by a third every three weeks at an effective protective coverage of 60% (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D) and by almost two thirds (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub> = 0.36) at an effective protective coverage of 70% (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E and F).
