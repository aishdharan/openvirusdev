 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, C, E and F) underlines the fundamental dangers of this approach. It also highlights the fact that there is very little room for relaxing current restrictions in many countries where they have proven barely sufficient to contain the epidemic and begin slowly shrinking it (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Saez, Tobias, Varga, &amp; Barcelo, 2020</xref>). Considering how easily and rapidly epidemics may spiral out of control when restrictions are relaxed or viral reproduction surges for a variety of other reasons (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, C, E and F), it is vital to remember that tipping points tip in both directions and are therefore dangerous places to linger. Deliberately planning to establish near-steady-state equilibria for epidemics with naturally volatile dynamics that are difficult to predict (
