<p>Measles is a relatively old human disease. Closely related to the rinderpest virus of cattle, the current global strain probably made the interspecies jump in the 11th century and has caused waves of disease ever since. It is another RNA virus that makes coronavirus look like an amateurâ€”it is spread so efficiently by the respiratory route that, on average, one case infects at least 15 people, compared to an estimated 2.5 by SARS-CoV-2. Spread is explosive, and outbreaks amplify rapidly [

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It can cause severe illness in infants, young children, and adults, and in outbreaks among malnourished infants it can kill 1 in 4. Before the introduction of the first vaccine in 1963, there were frequent global measles pandemics with an estimated annual death toll of 2.6 million. Because of its transmission efficiency, vaccination delivery has to reach 95% of all children to achieve herd immunity.
