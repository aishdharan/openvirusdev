<p>During the past decade, however, there has been a remarkable and gratifying acceleration in TB research and practice with progress on multiple fronts and across the entire prevention to cure continuum, and including new diagnostics, therapies, and people-centered strategies. The COVID-19 lockdown threatens these gains. A recent example of the unintended collateral consequences of enforced “stay at home” has been documented in South Africa, where TB remains the leading infectious disease cause of death. Following the national lockdown, a 48% average weekly decrease in TB Xpert diagnostic testing has occurred accompanied by a 33% decline in diagnoses of active TB and anticipated negative impact on TB control [

A mathematical model suggests that if the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global disruption in TB detection of just 25% for 3 months in multiple countries, a 13% increase in TB deaths would be expected, removing the reductions in TB mortality achieved during the past 5 years [
