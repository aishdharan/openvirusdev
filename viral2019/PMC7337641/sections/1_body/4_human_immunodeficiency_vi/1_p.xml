<p>HIV is a relatively new human infection. Another zoonosis, it made the species jump from chimpanzees to humans shortly after the First World War and transmitted through sex, blood, and birth; it has spread steadily following increasing globalization of commerce and travel. HIV is an efficient pathogen that has caused a massive global pandemic with an estimated 38 million people living with HIV infection (PLWH) and is responsible for an estimated 770 000 deaths in 2018 [

There has been great success in treatment, which although not curative, is exceptionally effective in suppressing viral replication and preservation of the immune system and reduces the mortality from almost 100% within 10 years to a normal life expectancy. Complete viral suppression prevents transmission and slows epidemic propagation. The largest public health programs ever implemented, including the Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund, have successfully delivered prevention and treatment to high burden countries around the world, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of a vaccine the efficient delivery of these prevention and treatment services to PLWH, identified by diagnostic testing as early as possible in the course of their disease, is the key component of continued success in combatting HIV globally.
