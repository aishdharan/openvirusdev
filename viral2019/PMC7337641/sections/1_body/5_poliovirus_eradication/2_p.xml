<p>Despite the tools available, poliovirus has continued to infect children in the poorest parts of the world. Wild-type poliovirus is still endemic in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria, and the case count of AFP has risen in the last 2 years. In addition, reverted vaccine strains have caused outbreaks in a number of African countries that have been unable to reach herd immunity levels of vaccination. Two months ago, in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative reluctantly halted all surveillance and vaccination activities worldwide [

This will inevitably result in more poliovirus cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have also had widespread SARS-CoV-2 introduction via the pilgrimage and trade routes from Iran. Vaccine strains will definitely infect more widely in Africa in coming days, weeks, and months. The elimination of the second human pathogen after smallpox seemed so close, but as a COVID-19 collateral casualty, it will now take years more to accomplish.
