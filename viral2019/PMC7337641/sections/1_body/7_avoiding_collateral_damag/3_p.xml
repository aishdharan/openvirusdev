<p>Central to the success of these integrated programs is protection of the healthcare workforce with procedures and personal protective equipment (PPE) proven to work for SARS-CoV-2 and other communicable diseases. Healthcare and community facilities and outreach and vaccination programs should be maintained at full capacity with safety training and provision of enough PPE for all healthcare workers. “Safe and Steady” is the message, not “Lockdown and COVID.” Innovative use of new practices including use of social media and community-based telemedicine can enhance safe delivery of services. The confidence of the public must be maintained that they are visiting safe and well-managed facilities and that community vaccination or contact tracing outreach and screening and testing is conducted in a safe and respectful fashion. Where possible, shifting services from healthcare facilities to community settings is desirable.</p>
