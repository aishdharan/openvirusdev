<p>Since its first identification in Malaysia (1998) and Singapore (1999), Nipah virus infection has caused multiple outbreaks that have thus far been limited to the Asian continent. Nipah@20 provided a forum to review the history and key scientific findings over the last 20â€‰years and to understand the current challenges in developing Nipah diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. To foster international collaboration in the context of epidemic preparedness, the conference brought together 218 scientists and public health professionals working in 21 different countries around the globe. Importantly, all henipavirus-affected countries (Australia, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore) were represented at the conference, with their delegations accounting for 46% of all attendees.</p>
