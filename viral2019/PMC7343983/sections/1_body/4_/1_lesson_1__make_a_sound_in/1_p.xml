<p>Nipah@20 brought together a community of scientists who, over the past 20 years, have passionately studied the epidemiology, virology, pathogenesis, and therapeutics of viruses that have pandemic potential. Many of the invited speakers were involved in understanding and responding to the 2002–2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) outbreak. It is no surprise that most of these scientists are currently involved in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the past 15 years, this scientific community has been heavily involved in warning governments about the possible emergence of pathogen X and about the need to invest in preparedness against such a pathogen.</p>
