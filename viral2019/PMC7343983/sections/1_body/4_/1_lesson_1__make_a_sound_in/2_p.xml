<p>In terms of policy and implementation, however, prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this scientific community had struggled to convince policy makers about the benefits to invest in research, development, and vaccine manufacturing preparedness against pandemics. As an example, even though Nipah disease has been known for more than 20â€‰years, investment on Nipah vaccine development has been limited. The development of a sound business/investment case remains a priority to conduct advocacy and to move forward the development of effective Nipah countermeasures. CEPI has estimated that, to bring four Nipah vaccine candidates through successful phase 2a clinical trials, an investment of up to 200 million U.S. dollars (USD) would be required, assuming no risk of failure (

This figure may seem high, but it pales in comparison to the economic and nonfinancial impact that a pandemic can create, as currently being demonstrated by COVID-19. Studies estimating the economic impact of past and present henipavirus outbreaks could provide valuable data to model a sound investment case for medical countermeasures against Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and other henipaviruses with pandemic potential. To maximize investments, the possibility of a pan-henipavirus vaccine should also be considered, similar to programs considering the development of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines (
