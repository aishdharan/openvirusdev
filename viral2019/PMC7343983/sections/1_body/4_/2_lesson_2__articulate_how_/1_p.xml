<p>Regarding progress and challenges in surveillance, scientists from several countries presented their research on Nipah and Henipavirus-like sequences found in bat samples throughout Asia and Africa. In addition, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has found several new viruses among bats and is exploring their EID potential. Opinions may vary on how to translate bat surveillance into policy and prevention of disease. However, it is clear that international collaboration and further investment on surveillance research are needed to propose policy and to prepare against potential new pathogens that will continue to emerge from bats and other animals in areas with high biodiversity (
