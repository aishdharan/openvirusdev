Two use cases for Nipah diagnostics include rapid detection of Nipah virus infections at a peripheral health center or hospital and confirmation of active Nipah virus infection at a centralized laboratory. For the former, a TPP would envision a near-patient/point-of-care (NPT/POC) test for rapid screening; for the latter, the TPP would envision a NPT/POC for rapid confirmation in settings with higher infrastructures (
