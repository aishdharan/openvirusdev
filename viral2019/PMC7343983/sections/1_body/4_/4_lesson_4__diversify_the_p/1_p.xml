<p>Two conference sessions were dedicated to Nipah pathogenesis in animal models and to transmission and case management in humans. Data were presented on aerosol and intranasal challenges in African green monkeys (AGM), intratracheal challenge in cynomolgus macaques, and intranasal challenge in ferrets. Although models vary in recapitulating specific aspects of Nipah disease observed in humans, there was no specific mention of myocarditis observed in heart tissue. Myocarditis has been a consistent observation among Nipah virus-infected patients in India and Bangladesh, but this has not yet been reported in animal models. It is possible that this difference may be due to early humane endpoints not allowing the heart tissue from infected animals to reach the level of myocarditis deterioration observed in some Nipah virus-infected humans. There was also mention of relapse and late onset of infection observed in Malaysian patients several years after the acute infection. There is no evidence of renewed viremia during relapsed encephalitis in humans, and there is currently no animal model for relapsing Nipah disease, although many investigators have proposed such research and its importance.</p>
