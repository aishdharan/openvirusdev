<p>For Nipah and henipaviral diseases, it is conceivable that an animal rule or similar regulatory pathway may be necessary to achieve licensure of vaccines and other countermeasures. Direct dialogue between preclinical scientists, pathologists, and health workers can better inform the design of animal models suitable for EID countermeasure development. Importantly, henipavirus research has benefited from having a diverse preclinical testing portfolio, as many different animal species are susceptible to disease, which means that preclinical studies do not have to be limited to the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs). This is also proving important for SARS-CoV-2, as research with NHPs, hamsters, mice, and ferrets ensures that COVID-19 vaccines can be tested simultaneously, according to each model, in a wider range of biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory facilities for large and small animals across the world (

In addition, the use of human organoids is also being explored as a model to better understand SARS-CoV-2 biology in human tissue (
