<p>Three sessions were dedicated to epidemiological needs for clinical trials and to review progress in the development of Nipah medical countermeasures. There are several therapeutics in development, including the following: lipid-anchored peptides to prevent viral fusion, low-cost compounds such as heparin, and a nasal spray with compounds for potential prophylactic use. There are also two monoclonal antibodies that can neutralize the virus and protect against Henipavirus infection and disease 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. One monoclonal antibody (m102.4) has completed a phase I trial in Australia and has been approved for compassionate use in humans (

Since antibodies do not cross the blood-brain barrier, for monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics to be effective, virus neutralization will likely have to occur in the respiratory tract, blood, and other tissues before the virus disseminates into the brain. However, multiple Nipah challenge models including NHPs indicate that passive immunization with Nipah neutralizing antibodies can also prevent central nervous system (CNS) involvement if administered at the first signs of Nipah disease.
