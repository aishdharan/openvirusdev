<p>There was discussion on what the optimal Nipah clinical trial design would be in the context of an EID with very low incidence, i.e., in the absence of feasible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies such as case-control studies could still provide valuable evidence. Relevant clinical trials for Nipah countermeasures will require engagement of local regulatory authorities in Bangladesh (Directorate General of Drug Administration [DGDA]) and India (Drug Controller General of India [DCGI]). Partnerships are being built locally, with a focus on equitable access and low-cost interventions. Recognizing that pathways to Nipah vaccine licensure are likely to vary across countries, early dialogue between regulators from Asia, Europe, and North America was facilitated during the conference, and an international, Nipah-focused regulatory group was created. Similarly, bringing regulators together early during COVID-19 medical countermeasure development could result in the identification of actions that can be harmonized or accelerated to meet common requirements or convergences along the pathway to licensure across multiple national regulatory agencies.</p>
