<p>Keith Chappell and Paul Young from the University of Queensland, in Brisbane, Australia, presented their molecular clamp approach to produce a highly stable prefusion form of the Nipah virus F glycoprotein, which is responsible for membrane fusion, and could be an additional target for neutralizing antibodies. The molecular clamp is a novel way of locking synthetic versions of viral surface proteins into the same shape that appears on the virus surface. This technology has been designed as a platform approach to generate vaccines against a range of human and animal viruses and has shown promising results in the laboratory targeting viruses such as influenza virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. This same principle is also being supported by CEPI to develop a recombinant, spike protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, with phase I trials expected to begin by July 2020.</p>
