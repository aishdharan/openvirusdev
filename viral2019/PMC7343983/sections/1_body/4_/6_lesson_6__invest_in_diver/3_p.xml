<p>Sarah Gilbert from the Jenner Institute, at Oxford University, United Kingdom, presented the ChAdOx1 Nipah vaccine, a simian adenovirus-based vaccine encoding Nipah virus (NiV) glycoprotein (G) Bangladesh. ChAdOx1 is a replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector which has been used for the development of vaccines against many pathogens in preclinical and clinical studies. It is safe for use in all ages and in patients who are immunocompromised, inducing strong and well-maintained humoral and T cell responses against the encoded antigen without the requirement for an adjuvant. A single dose of a ChAdOx1-vectored Nipah vaccine protects against homologous (Bangladesh strain) and heterologous (Malaysia strain) challenge in the intraperitoneal Syrian golden hamster challenge model (

A single dose of the vaccine, which encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, may confer protection against disease in a rhesus macaque pneumonia model (
