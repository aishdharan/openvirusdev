Although regulatory agencies are adapting to keep up with such a rapidly evolving vaccine pipeline, preparedness for future pandemics may necessitate regulatory frameworks to preapprove specific platforms with consistent safety data in order to save precious time when plugging in a novel pathogen sequence into a vaccine platform technology. For many COVID-19 platform technologies, dialogue is ongoing to articulate strategies for large-scale manufacturing (
