<p>The final conference session was dedicated to collaboration and synergy. Zhengli Shi, from the Wuhan Institute of Virology/Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), described how a Sino-French agreement to collaborate on EIDs was established in 2004, following the SARS-CoV outbreak. BSL4 labs were established in the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a result of the SARS-CoV outbreak. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the institute had an annual call launched around April each year for external organizations wanting access to the facility to test their own samples or to have access to samples from the in-house repositories. The many years of research experience and international collaborations built by the CAS since 2004 have provided a preparedness framework through which Chinese scientists have responded and continue to respond to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic 16 years later.</p>
