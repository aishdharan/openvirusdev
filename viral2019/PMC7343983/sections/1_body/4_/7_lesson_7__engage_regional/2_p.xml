<p>Nivedita Gupta, from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), described the Regional Enabler for the Southeast Asia Research Collaboration for Health (RESEARCH) platform. The RESEARCH platform was established on 28 August 2019, with ICMR as the secretariat. The goal of the platform is to facilitate clinical research across the region, leveraging the unique capabilities of each country and sharing expertise. Of the 11 member states in the WHO Southeast Asia Region, 10 participated in the second RESEARCH platform meeting. With the platform in place, it will be easier to mount rapid responses to new outbreaks and to conduct clinical trialsâ€”not only on Nipah virus, but also other EIDs.</p>
