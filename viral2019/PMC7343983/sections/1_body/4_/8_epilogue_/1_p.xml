<p>Unbeknownst to the scientists attending the Nipah@20 conference in Singapore in December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak had already begun. We started the year 2020 confronted with a new EID that required rapid mobilization for vaccine development. Nipah@20 was a scientific drill, a timely dialogue about the need to invest in the development of vaccines and medical countermeasures against EIDs with pandemic potential. CEPI has since mobilized early investment for several COVID-19 vaccine candidates. As stated earlier, for two awardees, this builds on work already undertaken with Nipah virus vaccine projects which were showcased at the Nipah@20 conference.</p>
