<p>The recent global pandemic of the coronavirus has sensitized the entire world to the importance of epidemiology and trend analysis. People all over the world are closely monitoring the rapidly changing landscape that reflects the aggressive nature of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that has engulfed the world affecting more than 183 countries at the time of this writing.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There are many myths associated with the spread of the virus that is being addressed by global agencies like the World Health Organization.[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] One of the popular speculative theories is the spread of the virus in varied climatic conditions with the notion that extreme climates may retard the same. The effect of a rise in the environmental temperature and the impact of the Indian summer on the spread of the virus needs to be ascertained in a local geographic setting. Among viruses relevant to ophthalmology, adenoviruses are probably the most commonly encountered type affecting the conjunctiva and cornea. The most frequent manifestation of ocular adenoviral infection is epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) followed by pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) with periodic outbreaks documented around the world.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In this context, the authors were interested to understand the temporal pattern of acute EKC of presumed adenoviral etiology which is one of the most common viral epidemics affecting humans annually. The authors intend to study the relationship between the effect of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and the prevalence of EKC in the population. This presents a unique insight into the temporal behavior of EKC and allows us the window of opportunity to learn in a geographic setting like India and is particularly relevant when the world is in the throes of a viral pandemic.
