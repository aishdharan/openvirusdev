<p>A total of 2,408,819 patients of all ages presented to the tertiary and secondary centers of the network during the study period. The standard protocol of managing a case of conjunctivitis in the network involves a high degree of suspicion for other differentials like microsporidial keratitis that is identified on clinical examination by raised epithelial lesions that are more prominent with fluorescein staining. These cases undergo epithelial scraping for microbiological evaluation.[
