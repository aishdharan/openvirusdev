<p>Descriptive statistics using mean Â± standard deviation and median with interquartile range (IQR) were used to elucidate the demographic data. Prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of EKC cases by the total number of patients presenting to the network from the given geographic location during the study period. The Medcal software (version 19.2.0) was used to perform Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis between the prevalence and individual weather parameters. The r-square (r
 <sup>2</sup>) value of 0.12 or below indicates low, between 0.13 and 0.25 values indicate medium, 0.26 or above values indicate high effect size.[
