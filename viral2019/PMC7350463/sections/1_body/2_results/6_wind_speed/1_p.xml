<p>The month-wise wind speed distribution is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>. the average windspeed from 2016–2019 was 7.28 km/h. The highest wind speed was seen in August (9.23 ± 4.7 km/h) and the lowest in January (5.06 ± 3.47 km/h). The month-wise prevalence of EKC was negatively correlated with the distribution of wind speed (r = -0.7535), and this correlation was statistically significant (r
