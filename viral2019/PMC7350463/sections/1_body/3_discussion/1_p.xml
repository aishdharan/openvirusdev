<p>This study sought to describe the correlation between the temporal pattern of presentation of acute EKC of presumed adenoviral etiology with meteorological parameters such as environmental temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed in a cohort of patients presenting to a multitier hospital network in India using electronic medical records-driven analytics. The findings of this study suggest that there is a complex interplay of environmental factors with the temporal pattern of EKC in the population of the district of Hyderabad with a peak prevalence seen in April and the lowest seen in July. An increase in rainfall, wind speed, and humidity contributes to a lower prevalence of EKC cases during the year, whereas surprisingly temperature did not have any bearing in the prevalence of EKC in the population. Therefore the findings of this study suggest that unlike popular perception, higher temperatures, or the onset of summer alone might not have a detrimental effect on the spread of viral epidemics. This information may have broader implications particularly in the context of viral outbreaks.</p>
