 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported a seasonal variation of adenoviral conjunctivitis in a total of 926 patients over 30 years in the United States. The seasonal trend was analyzed in four quarters in a year and the number of cases was highest in the months from July to September and lowest from April to June contrary to the findings in our study. The seasonal variation accounts for the disparity in months but the peak cases were seen in summer in both the geographies. In our study, the peak prevalence was noted in April which is in the peak of summer. This study lacked epidemiological information such as gender, age, and geography which are the strengths of our cohort and reported in our study.
