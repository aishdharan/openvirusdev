 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] analyzed the virology and epidemiology of global adenovirus-associated conjunctivitis outbreaks from 1953–2013 globally. The epidemiological findings suggested that EKC and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) were circulating predominantly in Asia during the early winter and spring, which is similar to our current study with the steady increase in prevalence from November to April. Of the 12 AHC outbreaks studied, there was one from southeast Asia from 1970–71 that occurred in May in 253 patients of the ages between 3–65 years. The study also concluded that EKC, AHC, and PCF outbreaks have different circulating patterns throughout the world and are caused by different adenovirus serotypes notably Ad8, Ad7, and Ad2 coinfection with enterovirus 70 (EV70).
