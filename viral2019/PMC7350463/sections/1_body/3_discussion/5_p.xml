 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in a recent analysis from 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases of COVID-19 reported that 1Â°C increase in temperature and 1% increase in relative humidity lower R (daily effective reproductive number) by 0.0383 and 0.0224, respectively. Using the daily R values from January 21 to 23, 2020 as proxies of non-intervened transmission intensity, they found under a linear regression framework for 100 Chinese cities that high temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This association highlights the importance of such surveillance during viral outbreaks. The negative correlation with humidity and prevalence of cases is strikingly similar in both the viruses, though there was no statistically significant correlation with temperature in our study. The aim of this study is not to draw a direct comparison between the temporal pattern of EKC and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak globally but to explore similarities among them. The two viruses of adenovirus (dsDNA) and coronavirus (ssRNA) are distinct and the fatality rate is significant in the latter and therapeutic information is evolving with each day.[
