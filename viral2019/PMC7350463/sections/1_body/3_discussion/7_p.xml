<p>The greatest strengths of this study were its high statistical power due to its large sample size and its utilization of completely digital data entry and extraction methods. The principal limitation of the study was its hospital-based method of selection of subjects which may have introduced a certain level of ascertainment bias and lack of molecular data of viral genotypes. We also have not considered the varying pattern of different viral strains with regards to yearly trends and their relation to weather. This limitation underlies the importance of having registries to identify new cases to ensure faster response and an understanding of the behavior of these viral epidemics at a larger scale in our nation. The establishment of a global adenovirus surveillance system that includes epidemiological and virological surveillance has been advocated to track the pattern of outbreaks in countries around the world.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Patients who are diagnosed with conjunctivitis of presumed adenoviral etiology must be investigated further for the type of viral strain and the information passed on to a nodal agency to help identify the type and pattern of the outbreaks in the population. The current study may not account for all the cases in the given geography due to the presentation bias to the hospital but lends insight into the existing pattern of the prevalence of EKC in the population to promote the prevention of disease and limit the spread of the same.
