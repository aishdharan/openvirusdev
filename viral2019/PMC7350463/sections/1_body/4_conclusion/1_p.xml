<p>In conclusion, this study aimed to describe the correlation between the temporal pattern of presentation of acute EKC of presumed adenoviral etiology with meteorological parameters such as environmental temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed in a cohort of patients from the district of Hyderabad presenting to a multitier ophthalmology hospital network in India. The findings show that an increase in rainfall, wind speed, and humidity contributes to a lower prevalence of EKC cases during the year and no statistically significant correlation with temperature was found. This is contrary to the popular perception of higher temperatures leading to lower risk of transmission of contagious viral infections and highlights the importance of regular surveillance for better preparedness in the event of viral outbreaks from a public health perspective.</p>
