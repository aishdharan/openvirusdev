Many were self-limiting and &#x0201c;went away&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;disappeared&#x0201d; almost as quickly as they appeared (SARS, MERS, ZIKAV). The origins in all cases were a mystery, and very controversial. Others such as the far more deadly HIV retrovirus has finally succumbed to highly effective antiretroviral therapy (HAART) making life bearable for infected HIV&#x000a0;+ people. However it has integrated into the human germline in many cases and is likely to be a permanent &#x0201c;endogenized retroviral signature&#x0201d; in the human germline, joining the many thousands of other HERVS, human endogenous retrovirus sequences that litter the human genome as fragments or potentially active retroviruses (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe &#x00026; Steele, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0110">However the great exemplar of the emergence of a new pandemic disease of considerable virulence and pathogenicity was the Spanish Flu Pandemic 1918&#x02013;1919.

We focus our analysis on the actual origins of two recently emergent epidemics: a fungal disease caused by <italic>Candida auris</italic> and the current coronavirus &#x0201c;common cold-type&#x0201d; epidemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. These two epidemics display distinctive features and clear evidence that they may have come from a space in-fall of infectious viruses and micro-organisms in cometary dust or meteorite-derived dust particles.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>2</label><title>Sudden simultaneous emergence of <italic>Candida auris</italic> infections in separate global regions</title><p id="p0120">Candida species are well-known yeasts that can cause a variety of cutaneous and invasive infections; however, they had never been considered a serious global health threat until the recent emergence of <italic>Candida auris</italic>. This was first reported in the ear canal of a patient in Japan in 2009. Since then, cases have been recorded on all continents except Antarctica (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Rhodes &#x00026; Fisher, 2019</xref>). It can cause a variety of invasive infections with a mortality rate of up to 60%, typically infecting susceptible hosts, namely those with long hospitalizations, many illnesses and impaired immunity (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bradley, 2019</xref>). In addition, it can be resistant to multiple antifungals and has the capacity to cause outbreaks within healthcare facilities (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Chow et al., 2018</xref>). Its ability to colonize and persist for a long time on human skin, tolerate some disinfectants that are commonly used in healthcare settings, and to survive on inanimate surfaces for many weeks, all contribute to its effectiveness as an outbreak agent (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0125">Even more remarkable though is its emergence. An analysis of whole genomic sequencing from 54 isolates of <italic>C. auris</italic> from four regions around the world revealed four major clades or genetically distinct populations. This finding supports the hypothesis of the nearly simultaneous and independent emergence of these clades in geographically separate human populations The SENTRY Antifungal Surveillance Program is a global system that has continued for 20 years (1997&#x02013;2016). It collects consecutive invasive <italic>Candida</italic> isolates from medical centers located in four regions during each calendar year, namely: North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Pfaller, Diekema, Turnidge, Castanheira, &#x00026; Jones, 2019</xref>). Despite going back to 1997, the SENTRY data did not identify <italic>C. auris</italic> until 2009 (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, the earliest <italic>C. auris</italic> isolates were found in South Korea in 1996 and Japan in 1997 (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Forsberg et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0130">Although it is a Candida species, <italic>C. auris</italic> is quite distinct from its Candidal relatives. The genus consists of &#x0003e;&#x000a0;500 species, many of which greatly differ from each other. <italic>C. auris</italic> comes from the Clavispora clade of the Metschnikowiaceae family. It has not been identified from any natural environments (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>). It is relatively thermotolerant in that it can grow at temperatures as high as 42&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Such thermotolerance could potentially allow it to infect avian hosts (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0135">Thus, infections caused by the fungus <italic>Candida</italic> spp. have been recognized for many years. However, of interest here is the abrupt emergence of a new strain <italic>Candida auris</italic> which presents a profound puzzle (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al., 2017</xref>). This new strain which is multi-drug resistant has emerged as a major cause of mortality and is posing a serious challenge for health officials the world over (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chowdhary, Sharma, &#x00026; Meis, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Cortegiani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Jeffery-Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al., 2017</xref>). While <italic>Candida auris</italic> was reported for the first time in Japan in 2009 it appears to have been <italic>isolated more or less simultaneously</italic> in many widely separated locations across the world.</p><p id="p0140">Phylogenetic analysis by <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al. (2017)</xref> has identified four distinct clades separated by tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) each of which is geographically localized. A large number of SNPs have been discovered in isolates that were recovered from four widely separated locations (South Asia, East Asia, South America, and South Africa). Whole genome sequencing of these isolates has revealed an exceedingly low genetic diversity within individual regions even across the largest clade involving some 36 isolates from as wide a field as India and Pakistan. The conclusion by <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al. (2017)</xref> is that <italic>C. auris</italic> must have arisen almost simultaneously in multiple four different global locations. Further, from isolates of <italic>Candida</italic> from four continents <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al. (2017)</xref> did not find <italic>C. auris</italic> before 2009 confirming that this pathogen was not simply misidentified previously. While there have been claims that earlier isolates of Candida species may also have been <italic>Candida auris</italic> which were incorrectly identified, these assertions have not been confirmed. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that a 2009 date for the origin <italic>Candida auris</italic> is fairly secure (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Cortegiani et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0145">Since global cross-infection over a short timescale (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1 year) appears very unlikely one possibility is of independent multiple origins of <italic>Candida auris</italic> from some widely present <italic>Candida</italic> ancestor. A fungicide driver model has been advanced to explain the phenomenon. However this vague model does not fit the available data. We thus argue here that a panspermic in-fall model should be considered as a plausible and better alternative.</p><p id="p0150">Thus, in our explanation (from all the available data) it could be concluded that <italic>C. auris</italic> first arose in 2009 from several environmentally-induced hypermutation events that occurred after in-fall from cosmic (cometary) dust clouds through which the Earth had traversed sometime during or before 2009. Thus this new <italic>C. auris</italic> would appear simultaneously in many widely separated places on the Earth. Alternatively, a genetic hybridization event may have taken place at this time involving a globally distributed set of comet-borne gene segments that were themselves genetically diverse.</p><p id="p0155">How could this have occurred? We critically evaluate the data from a genetic point of view. The data demands that there are at least four pre-existing clades (&#x02265;&#x000a0;10,000 SNP differences) in an external non-terrestrial source (cometary dust tails) and these came down separately in separate regions and thereafter spread clonally (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al., 2017</xref>). The other alternative is to consider the existence of a single &#x0201c;mother&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;parent&#x0201d; <italic>C. auris</italic> clade in the cometary dust source, which upon landing and infection of susceptible hosts is induced into a hypermutation-adaptation sequence via a fast, essentially Lamarckian, Adaptive Mutation strategy (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg, 2001</xref>; Chapter &#x0201c;The Efficient Lamarckian Spread of Life in the Cosmos&#x0201d; by Steele et al.) thereby generating in excess of 10,000 new SNP differences from the parent orbiting cosmic strain. The final step that can be envisaged is the dispersal of a successful adaptive variant in a particular region to other hospitals in that region. Thus on the basis of a Panspermic model there are two possible explanations for the strange and striking <italic>C. auris</italic> patterns of genome diversity. The Lamarckian hypermutation strategy at each separate in-fall location (susceptible hospital patients) from a pure line &#x0201c;mother&#x0201d; strain is, on parsimony grounds, preferred.</p><p id="p0160">We have previously argued that a sudden emergence of new pathogenic variants of circulating viruses could be linked to cosmic events related to the well-known 11-year sunspot cycle (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Qu and Wickramasinghe, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Qu and Wickramasinghe, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe et al., 2019</xref>). The Earth's magnetosphere, and the interplanetary magnetic field in its vicinity, are both modulated by the solar wind that controls the flow of charged particles onto the Earth. During times of sunspot minima, a general weakening of magnetic field occurs and this would be accompanied by an increase in the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR's) and also of charged interstellar and interplanetary dust particles. Evidence for such periodic increases linked to solar activity is evident in the high frequency of noctilucent clouds (as at present, in 2019&#x02013;2020) and also in the increase of particulate deposits in polar ice cores. Since the latter could, in our view, include biological entities such as bacteria, viruses and other eukaryotic microorganisms like <italic>C. auris</italic>, an increase in their incidence on the Earth will therefore be expected at such times. It is interesting to note that in 2008&#x02013;2009 (the solar minimum under discussion) the interplanetary magnetic field was the lowest on record since the beginning of the space age. We would therefore expect a significantly enhanced flux of both cosmic rays as well as electrically charged biological entities at this time, so the arrival of a new clade of <italic>C. auris</italic> from a space source should not be ignored.</p><p id="p0165">A crucial fact relating to the first appearance of <italic>Candia auris</italic> in 2009 is that this time marks not merely a solar minimum but <italic>the lowest minimum</italic> of the sunspot cycle in 100 years (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).
This particular minimum was all the more remarkable because the sun was spotless (devoid of spots) for more than 70% of the time. The opportunity of the transference of both Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR's) and charged molecular structures (e.g., <italic>C. auris</italic>) thus remained continuously optimal over extended periods. At the present time (February 2020) as we approach a new sunspot minimum the sun continues to be exceedingly &#x0201c;quiet&#x0201d; and the expectations are that we are heading for an even deeper minimum than before. The case for epidemiological vigilance for new microbial and viral pathogens cannot be greater than at the present time.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The distribution of the number spotless days in the Sunspot cycle, showing the period 2008/2009 to be the lowest on record for a century.

It is without parallel in our experience in this social media internet age. However, it does approach the justified hysteria around the far more serious, and initially more lethal, HIV epidemic/pandemic that suddenly emerged 40 years ago.</p><p id="p0180">The actual COVID-19 viral disease itself causes respiratory &#x0201c;common cold-like&#x0201d; illness in most people diagnosed with symptoms (but many potential carriers of the disease are asymptomatic). The infection can progress to severe pneumonia in elderly and already medically-compromised patients with other conditions (diabetes, coronary disease, etc.). About 2% of all COVD-19 cases have died due to the pneumonia (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Vaccine and antivirals will not help the latter group, but standard well trusted medical care will&#x02014;to help patients through the respiratory crisis of the life-threatening pneumonia and dangerous inflammatory bronchitis symptoms.

The fact that &#x0201c;Recoveries&#x0201d; far exceed &#x0201c;Deaths&#x0201d; (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) indicates that timely medical care for this otherwise &#x0201c;common cold&#x0201d; respiratory illness must be the medical priority in the epicenter of the infection in Wuhan and nearby regions in China. We believe this medical care is being implemented throughout China.</p><p id="p0185">But it is the origin of this new emergent virus disease which has raised the most angst. It is literally explosively centred on Wuhan, which appears to be the epicenter. And it appeared suddenly without warning. The theory that it jumped from bats via snakes to humans is implausible (below). The same angst over viral origins was also evident when HIV, SARS, MERS, Ebola, and ZIKAV suddenly appeared on the scene. We will not deal with these earlier diseases as their origins, in our considered opinion, are far less clear cut than COVID-19.</p><p id="p0190">However sorting out what is true from what is untrue is a challenge.

This is contrary to normal expectations as usually the infected potential spreader would display overt and full blown disease (and the coughed-up aerosols from such a patient would be dense with viral particles). Indeed, there are wide reports in the media that incubation times can range from 1 to 28 days. But once a potentially infective virus successfully navigates the Innate Immune response (see table 1, Chapter &#x0201c;The Efficient Lamarckian Spread of Life in the Cosmos&#x0201d; by Steele et al.) it would be expected to rapidly multiply within cells and spread peaking in virion numbers 5&#x02013;7 days later. The actual size of the infective dose is also an important variable. So these wide-range estimates of incubation time reflect, in our view, the variable depth and extent of the <italic>actual physical viral contamination</italic> in the immediate environment of a susceptible subject viz. potentially all objects in the family home environment as well as cars, bicycles, and on their bodies&#x02014;hair, clothes&#x02014;and other personal effects, clothes, money, keys, etc. Indeed, the external surface of the face mask may be the main carrier of the physical contamination. We explore the extent of viral environmental contamination further below.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>3.2</label><title>Detailed analysis of COVID-19 epidemic</title><p id="p0215">We now analyze all reliable genetic, epidemiological and geophysical and astrophysical data. This leads to the alternate hypothesis that COVID-19 arrived via a meteorite, a presumed relatively fragile and loose carbonaceous meteorite, that struck North East China on October 11, 2019. This is at odds with the main stream expert &#x0201c;Infectious Disease&#x0201d; opinion of traditional person-to-person spread of an infectious endemic disease such as, for example, Cholera (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>).</p><p id="p0220">We then assume the viral debris and particles then made land fall in the Wuhan and related regions about a month to 6 weeks later resulting in first cases of the viral pneumonia caused by COVID-19 emerging in Wuhan regions late November 2019-early December 2019 (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Such an hypothesis is indeed consistent with the striking patterns shown in <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. And it makes, therefore, an extraordinary set of predictions, that we will explore at some length in our conclusions.</p><p id="p0225">It suggests, first, massive region-wide physical contamination with potentially trillions of infective COVID-19 viral particles in central China-contaminating buildings, roadways, cars and factory equipment, vegetation, surface water pools, people (and their clothes, body parts such as hair, skin, personal affects, mobile phone, keys, wallets, etc.) as well as wild and domestic animals, etc. This would explain the actions of the Chinese Government who are acting to appear to be in receipt of such presumed knowledge (or information) from region-wide sampling to detect COVID-19 RNA sequences in swabs from physical objects, people and animals (via real time PCR).</p><p id="p0230">The recent paper by <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2020)</xref> and the extremely important news commentary by Cohen in <italic>Science</italic> (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2020</xref>) highlights many unusual aspects of the outbreak of COVID-19. The evidence demonstrates that many cases of disease (about 30% of case reports) arose in locations unconnected with the Wuhan seafood and meat market, and the total tally continues to increase. Phylogenetic analyses of COVID-19 (previously named nCov-2019) sequences show little by way of sequence variation thus indicating low mutation rates thus approximating closely to what would be expected for a pure culture, of a single infecting and replicating sequence affecting disease cases (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Andersen, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). These facts are now combined with the global epidemiological data, that points in the main to little or no really sustained human-to-human transmission thus far (e.g., latest reports by the Australian Department of Health). We are aware there are apparent exceptions, e.g., the &#x0201c;super-spreader&#x0201d; from Singapore, via the French Alps, and then to a United Kingdom GP surgery reporting mild symptoms, resulting in the GPs also getting the disease (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>). We interpret that spread by viral contamination of physical objects in the main rather than direct &#x0201c;cough in your face&#x0201d; human to human spread.</p><p id="p0235">In any case, current data suggest that the human-to-human spread rate is unusually low, and may be dependent on proximity and dose of virus delivered at very close quarters. The &#x0201c;lethality&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;death rate&#x0201d; from this or any other epidemic disease increases in older patients with pre-existing conditions so wider global estimates yield a death rate at 2% of infected (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). All these basic facts now appear agreed.</p><p id="p0240">The initial traditional explanation of the new epidemic of COVID-19 is that it jumped from bats (possibly via snakes) to humans and then spread by human-to-human infection contact mutating at a high rate. This explanation is at odds with the data at present. Indeed Jon Cohen the respected <italic>Science</italic> magazine journalist reports that the head of the <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2020)</xref> study when interviewed said:<disp-quote><p>Bin Cao of Capital Medical University, the corresponding author of <italic>The Lancet</italic> article and a pulmonary specialist, wrote in an email to <italic>ScienceInsider</italic> that he and his co-authors &#x0201c;appreciate the criticism&#x0201d; from Lucey (Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University confirmed the epidemic could not possibly be caused by visits to the Wuham seafood and meat market).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="p0245">
<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;Now It seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,&#x0201d; he wrote. &#x0201c;<italic>But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now</italic>.&#x0201d; (our italics)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="p0250">Indeed Dr. Bin Cao speaks for all mainstream medical and epidemiological professionals around the world&#x02014;no formal traditional explanation can be provided for the origins of COVID-19. Thus Andrew Rambaut, Professor of Molecular Evolution at the University of Edinburgh tweeted: &#x0201c;Don't think any epidemiologist is still thinking that a non-human animal reservoir has had anything to do with the nCoV-2019 epidemic since December.</p><p id="p0255">Certainly the genome data doesn't support that.&#x0201d; (Reported in Heidi Han and Kieran Gair, Associated Press, <italic>The Australian</italic> newspaper January 27, 2020.)</p><p id="p0260">Thus, when we combine all the available facts we cannot rule out a viral in-fall event targeting the Wuhan province and the wider region around it as an explanation as a first cause of the epidemic. This would fit with the admittedly heterodox view of viral pandemics first proposed by Hoyle and Wickramasinghe as far back as 1978 (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Hoyle and Wickramasinghe, 1979</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Hoyle and Wickramasinghe, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe, Wainwright, &#x00026; Narlikar, 2003</xref>). This concept accords with the theory of cosmic biology for which growing evidence have recently been presented in the Chapters of this book and in recent peer-reviewed papers where all the main extant evidence has been reviewed and is consistent with the Hoyle-Wickramsinghe thesis (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Steele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Steele, Al-Mufti, et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Steele, Gorczynski, et al., 2019</xref>). Our theory thus posits a sporadic input of cosmic bacteria, viruses and other micro-organisms that has the potential to interact with evolving terrestrial life forms, causing terrestrial diseases and further adaptive evolution on Earth.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>3.3</label><title>Link with a direct strike of meteorite over central-North East China, October 11, 2019</title><p id="p0265">In the case of the current coronavirus epidemic in China it is interesting to note that an exceptionally bright fireball event was seen on October 11, 2019 over Sonjyan City in the Jilin Province of NE China (see <xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>
). It is tempting to speculate that this event (although it happened hundreds of kilometers distant from Hubei) had a crucial role to play in what is now unfolding in and throughout China. Indeed, the match with the Johns Hopkins University case incidence patterns is so striking it is difficult to easily dismiss this as a chance correspondence of patterns, in both time and place (e.g., <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).<fig id="f0045"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>The public record of this meteorite strike can be found at the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Space.com" id="ir0015">Space.com</ext-link> website in an article by Tariq Malik, on October 13, 2019 &#x0201c;Brilliant Midnight Fireball Lights Up Sky Over Northeast China&#x0201d;.

Indeed, a much larger original meteoroid could easily have been fragmenting and dispersing its contents before the ignition of the fireball event. A reasonable assumption is that the fireball which struck 2000&#x000a0;km N of Wuhan may have been part of a wide tube of debris the bulk of which was deposited in the stratosphere to fall over Wuhan. The fall time through the atmosphere of 1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m-sized solid particles could range from a few months to well over a year on the basis of straightforward calculations (e.g., in the Appendix of <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Hoyle &#x00026; Wickramasinghe, 1979</xref> &#x0201c;Diseases from space&#x0201d;). Because dispersal at ground level depends on the vagaries of meteorology and precipitation the deposition of virus at ground level is expected to be patchy in regard to both time and place. This is certainly consistent (thus far) with what has happened in relation to the new COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic between November 2019 and the present day (February 15, 2020). Following the initial deposition of infective particles in a small localized region (e.g., Wuhan, Hubei province, China) particles that have already become dispersed over a wider area in the troposphere will fall to ground in a higgledy-piggledy manner, and this process could be extended over a typical timescale of 1&#x02013;2 years until an initial inoculant of the infective agent would be drained. This accords well with many new strains of viruses including influenza that have appeared in recent years (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0275">The possible link of sunspots with pandemics has been discussed over many years (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Qu and Wickramasinghe, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Qu and Wickramasinghe, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe et al., 2019</xref>) and is worthy of brief further discussion. The present cycle (interface between cycles 24 and 25, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) has seen the lowest minimum for well over a century with many sunspot free days recorded in the last months of 2019. Sunspot minima are associated with a weakening of the interplanetary magnetic field near the Earth, which in turn allows easy ingress of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and electrically charged bacteria and viruses to the Earth. The mutagenic role of GCRs can cause genetic changes in already circulating viruses, but it is primarily to an enhanced flux of new infective particles released by the exploding meteoroid that we turn. Indeed a perfect storm over China is paying out before our eyes, a meteorite delivering COVID-19 particles corresponding with a very significant Sunspot Minimum cycle. It raises the important issue: How would other densely populated countries have reacted to, and handled, this event involving COVID-19? It was only the vagaries of chance that it exploded over China.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0280">We conclude by noting some predictions and expectations:<list list-type="simple" id="l0025"><list-item id="u0055"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0285">We expect the pattern of further spread of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) to be dictated mostly by primary in-fall until a high level of person-to-person infectivity might <italic>possibly</italic> be achieved and the virus then acquires the status of an endemic virus.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0060"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0290">Viral contamination of the &#x0201c;environment&#x0201d; in the most general sense explains most of the apparent contagion, e.g., news reports like in <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0065"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0295">Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the <italic>Diamond Princess</italic> cruise ship (and the more recent Westerdam cruiseship) in the South China Sea was contaminated by a fragment of the main COVID-19 dust cloud.

If such microbial agents are introduced via the agency of cometary bolides that survive frictional heating in the mesosphere, their fragmentation and dispersal as clouds of particles in the stratosphere will determine the way in which they finally arrive at the surface of the Earth.</p><p id="p0345">The falling speed of spherical particles of various sizes (with a notional density 1&#x000a0;g cm<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;3</sup>) through the atmosphere can be calculated as a function of height (y-axis) was calculated from formulae and data given by <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Kasten (1968)</xref>. The results are shown in <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. A1</xref>
. We note from the extreme right curve of <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. A1</xref> that a particle of radius 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m falls through the lowest 10&#x000a0;km of the stratosphere at a speed of ~&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;cm/s and so takes only a few days to cover what for smaller particles is the slowest part of their downward journey. All such particles fall comparatively rapidly through the mesosphere (z&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80&#x02013;50&#x000a0;km), and then more and more slowly down through the stratosphere below z&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;km. A particle with the size of a typical bacterium ~&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, falls through the lowest 10&#x000a0;km of the stratosphere at a speed of about 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;2</sup>
&#x000a0;cm/s and thus falls to ground in a time-scale of ~&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>7</sup>
&#x000a0;
<italic>s</italic>, that is about 2 years. Because there is more of the stratosphere through which such a particle must fall at high latitudes than in the tropics (the troposphere being higher in the tropics) the slow part of the journey is more extended the higher the latitude. A bacterium falling in ~&#x000a0;1 year in the tropics would fall in ~&#x000a0;2 years in temperate latitudes and in 2&#x02013;3 years towards the poles.<fig id="f0050"><label>Fig. A1</label><caption><p>Falling speed of spherical dust particles as a function of height in the atmosphere.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0050">Fig. A1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="f06-09-9780128215180_lrg"/><attrib>Reproduced from Hoyle &#x00026; Wickramasinghe. 1982, <italic>Proofs that life is cosmic</italic>, Mem.

&#x000a0;s, that is about 30 years (see <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. A1</xref>). This is so slow that other means of descent involving large-scale air movements in the stratosphere have to be considered. Further, the possibility of large clumps of viruses encased in cosmic dust particles will also change the relative effective sizes of infective particles and consequently their speeds of entry. We say this because &#x02026; &#x0201c;The sophistication of viral infectivity and their <italic>modus operandi</italic> of cell-cell spreading does not end here &#x02026; viral genomes &#x02026; can be propagated almost indefinitely (<xref rid="bb9605" ref-type="bibr">Combe, Garijo, Geller, Cuevas, &#x00026; Sanjuan, 2015</xref>) as &#x02018;virion clusters&#x02019; of mixtures of infective and crippled genomes with significant numbers of newly minted virus particles enwrapped in protective membrane vesicles&#x02014;a type of multiunit nanoparticle. This then constitutes the actual infective dose (<italic>or unit</italic>) rather than just a single exported virion entering a nearby target cell to cause a productive infection as is commonly believed (<xref rid="bb9600" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb9605" ref-type="bibr">Combe et al., 2015</xref>).&#x0201d; Text and references from <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Steele et al. (2018)</xref>.</p><p id="p0355">Thus, although in general vertical mass movements of air are feeble compared to those in the troposphere, some vertical stratospheric movement takes place despite the inhibiting effect of an inverted temperature gradient. The physical mechanism for mass stratospheric movements is the equator-to-pole temperature difference which acts as a heat engine across parallels of latitude, a heat engine that operates more strongly the larger the temperature difference&#x02014;i.e., much more strongly in winter than in the summer. A similar mechanism applies also to the troposphere, where an engine crossing parallels of latitude transfers heat from tropical regions towards the poles, again more in winter than in the summer.</p><p id="p0360">Ozone measurements can be used to trace the mass movements of air in the stratosphere. Such measurements show a winter downdraft that is strongest over the latitude range 40&#x02013;60 degrees. Taking advantage of this annual downdraft, individual virus particles (or dust-encased clumps) incident on the atmosphere from space would therefore reach ground-level generally in temperate latitudes, which therefore emerge from these considerations as the regions of the Earth where upper respiratory infections are likely to be most prevalent. This is true on the supposition that the Earth is smooth, which of course it is not. The exceptionally high mountains of the Himalayas on the North India-China boundary rearing up through most of the height range to the stratosphere, introduce a large perturbation to the smooth condition, which may be expected to affect adversely this particular region of the Earth, particularly China. In effect the Himalayan peaks, higher than 8&#x000a0;km, could act as a drain plug for most of the viruses incident on the atmosphere at latitude about 30 degrees N. The vast 1.4 billion population of China will thus be inundated by this drainage effect making China the quickest and worst affected region of the planet for cosmic pathogen-particle in-falls. As a consequence other parts of the Earth at about 30 degrees N could fortunately be largely free of incoming viral particles, unless it happens that such particles are incident as components within larger particles.</p><p id="p0365">A direct proof that the winter downdraft effect in the stratosphere occurs overwhelmingly over the latitude range 40&#x02013;60 degrees was demonstrated by <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kalkstein (1961)</xref>. In the last of the series of nuclear bombs that were tested in the atmosphere, a radioactive tracer element Rh-102 was introduced into the atmosphere at a height above 100&#x000a0;km and the fall out of the tracer was measured month by month through airplane and balloon sampling at altitudes of ~&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;km. The radioactive tracer Rh-102 took more than a decade to clear itself through repeated seasonal downdrafts of the kind we have described. The fall out was found to be much greater at temperate latitudes than elsewhere with the period January to March being the dominant months for the Northern Hemisphere. This is exactly similar to the pattern of incidence of influenza and other seasonal respiratory viral diseases in Northern temperate latitudes, a situation that is well-known to every medical practitioner and health authority. In the Southern hemisphere the situation is similar but 6 months displaced. This is clearly evident in <xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. B1</xref>
. Note that in a tropical location such as Sri Lanka no discernible seasonal effect can be detected in the data between 1968 and 1974.<fig id="f0055"><label>Fig. B1</label><caption><p>Incidence of seasonal influenza A in three countries.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0055">Fig. B1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="f06-10-9780128215180_lrg"/><attrib>Reproduced from Hoyle &#x00026; Wickramasinghe.

Confirmed cases are approaching 9 million and confirmed global deaths as June 22 are 468,589. We have updated our analysis here as the pandemic further unfolded. These analyses are now in several papers which have been published (or under-submission) since this paper was drafted. The most important developments are covered in the new citations in the reference list (and below), particularly our discussion on the progress of the major explosive outbreaks following the original epidemic in Wuhan through December-January 2020. Initially, in February, this appeared to go from China across the Pacific to the US West Coast (<xref rid="bb9625" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe et al., 2020b</xref>), but it then became apparent the putative viral-laden meteorite dust clouds moved along the north 40&#x000b0; latitude band heading in a westerly direction from China towards Europe (<xref rid="bb9630" ref-type="bibr">Wickramasinghe et al., 2020c</xref>). We speculate this transportation took place mainly in the Stratosphere and upper Troposphere, and this helps explain in part the major explosive outbreaks of COVID-19 in the temporal order, Tehran/Qom, Italy/Lombardy, Spain then New York City all on the north 40&#x000b0; latitude band. The genetic sequence of the virus has been analyzed where available in each of the major explosive locations, particularly Wuhan and New York City (Steele &#x00026; Lindley, 2020). Contrary to a widely held perception that the COVID-19 is a hypermutating contagious virus it is still the case, at the time of writing, that the most vulnerable at risk of death through respiratory complications are the co-morbid elderly. Further, the virus does not hypermutate, it appears to a use a riboswitch-mediated haplotype variation strategy which could be associated with the ethnic-genetic background of the subjects infected. Thus the genetic sequence of the virus in Wuhan/China, West Coast USA (February, 2020), Spain and New York City is essentially &#x02265;99.98% identical apart from a small set of key variant putative riboswitch sites (ranging from 2 to 5 on average across the length of the 29,903 nt RNA genome) which define a given haplotype. Thus, there is much haplotype homogeneity in China, but considerable haplotype diversity in New York City. The virus appears to adapt to new host genetic backgrounds by switching putative haplotype presumably allowing superior RNA replication in that cellular environment. The only factor we cannot explain then is why the super explosions of the viral epidemics in certain locations and not others. One likely factor would be the infective dose of the virus which we predict was far greater at these epicentre locations because it came in as a high dose in-fall in meteorite dust from the upper atmosphere.</p></sec></sec><ack id="ac0010"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We thank Professor Sanjaya Senanayake for bringing the <italic>Candida auris</italic> data to our attention and for discussions.</p></ack></back></article>
