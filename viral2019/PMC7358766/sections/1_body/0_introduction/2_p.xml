<p id="p0105">In the past 40 years there have been a number of suddenly emerging epidemic viral diseases. Many were self-limiting and “went away” or “disappeared” almost as quickly as they appeared (SARS, MERS, ZIKAV). The origins in all cases were a mystery, and very controversial. Others such as the far more deadly HIV retrovirus has finally succumbed to highly effective antiretroviral therapy (HAART) making life bearable for infected HIV + people. However it has integrated into the human germline in many cases and is likely to be a permanent “endogenized retroviral signature” in the human germline, joining the many thousands of other HERVS, human endogenous retrovirus sequences that litter the human genome as fragments or potentially active retroviruses (
