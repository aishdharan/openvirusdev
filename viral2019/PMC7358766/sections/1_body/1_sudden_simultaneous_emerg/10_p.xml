<p id="p0160">We have previously argued that a sudden emergence of new pathogenic variants of circulating viruses could be linked to cosmic events related to the well-known 11-year sunspot cycle (

The Earth's magnetosphere, and the interplanetary magnetic field in its vicinity, are both modulated by the solar wind that controls the flow of charged particles onto the Earth. During times of sunspot minima, a general weakening of magnetic field occurs and this would be accompanied by an increase in the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR's) and also of charged interstellar and interplanetary dust particles. Evidence for such periodic increases linked to solar activity is evident in the high frequency of noctilucent clouds (as at present, in 2019–2020) and also in the increase of particulate deposits in polar ice cores. Since the latter could, in our view, include biological entities such as bacteria, viruses and other eukaryotic microorganisms like 
 <italic>C. auris</italic>, an increase in their incidence on the Earth will therefore be expected at such times. It is interesting to note that in 2008–2009 (the solar minimum under discussion) the interplanetary magnetic field was the lowest on record since the beginning of the space age. We would therefore expect a significantly enhanced flux of both cosmic rays as well as electrically charged biological entities at this time, so the arrival of a new clade of 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> from a space source should not be ignored.
