<p id="p0165">A crucial fact relating to the first appearance of 
 <italic>Candia auris</italic> in 2009 is that this time marks not merely a solar minimum but 
 <italic>the lowest minimum</italic> of the sunspot cycle in 100 years (see 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This particular minimum was all the more remarkable because the sun was spotless (devoid of spots) for more than 70% of the time. The opportunity of the transference of both Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR's) and charged molecular structures (e.g., 
 <italic>C. auris</italic>) thus remained continuously optimal over extended periods. At the present time (February 2020) as we approach a new sunspot minimum the sun continues to be exceedingly “quiet” and the expectations are that we are heading for an even deeper minimum than before. The case for epidemiological vigilance for new microbial and viral pathogens cannot be greater than at the present time.
