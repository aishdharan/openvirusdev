<p id="p0125">Even more remarkable though is its emergence. An analysis of whole genomic sequencing from 54 isolates of 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> from four regions around the world revealed four major clades or genetically distinct populations. This finding supports the hypothesis of the nearly simultaneous and independent emergence of these clades in geographically separate human populations The SENTRY Antifungal Surveillance Program is a global system that has continued for 20 years (1997â€“2016). It collects consecutive invasive 
 <italic>Candida</italic> isolates from medical centers located in four regions during each calendar year, namely: North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific (

 <italic>C. auris</italic> until 2009 (
