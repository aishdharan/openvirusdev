<p id="p0140">Phylogenetic analysis by 
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al. (2017)</xref> has identified four distinct clades separated by tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) each of which is geographically localized. A large number of SNPs have been discovered in isolates that were recovered from four widely separated locations (South Asia, East Asia, South America, and South Africa). Whole genome sequencing of these isolates has revealed an exceedingly low genetic diversity within individual regions even across the largest clade involving some 36 isolates from as wide a field as India and Pakistan. The conclusion by 
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al. (2017)</xref> is that 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> must have arisen almost simultaneously in multiple four different global locations. Further, from isolates of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> from four continents 
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al. (2017)</xref> did not find 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> before 2009 confirming that this pathogen was not simply misidentified previously. While there have been claims that earlier isolates of Candida species may also have been 
 <italic>Candida auris</italic> which were incorrectly identified, these assertions have not been confirmed. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that a 2009 date for the origin 
 <italic>Candida auris</italic> is fairly secure (
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Cortegiani et al., 2018</xref>).
