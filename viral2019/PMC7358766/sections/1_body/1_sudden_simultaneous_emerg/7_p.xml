<p id="p0145">Since global cross-infection over a short timescale (&lt;Â 1 year) appears very unlikely one possibility is of independent multiple origins of 
 <italic>Candida auris</italic> from some widely present 
 <italic>Candida</italic> ancestor. A fungicide driver model has been advanced to explain the phenomenon. However this vague model does not fit the available data. We thus argue here that a panspermic in-fall model should be considered as a plausible and better alternative.
