<p id="p0150">Thus, in our explanation (from all the available data) it could be concluded that 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> first arose in 2009 from several environmentally-induced hypermutation events that occurred after in-fall from cosmic (cometary) dust clouds through which the Earth had traversed sometime during or before 2009. Thus this new 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> would appear simultaneously in many widely separated places on the Earth. Alternatively, a genetic hybridization event may have taken place at this time involving a globally distributed set of comet-borne gene segments that were themselves genetically diverse.
