<p id="p0155">How could this have occurred? We critically evaluate the data from a genetic point of view. The data demands that there are at least four pre-existing clades (≥ 10,000 SNP differences) in an external non-terrestrial source (cometary dust tails) and these came down separately in separate regions and thereafter spread clonally (
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al., 2017</xref>). The other alternative is to consider the existence of a single “mother” or “parent” 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> clade in the cometary dust source, which upon landing and infection of susceptible hosts is induced into a hypermutation-adaptation sequence via a fast, essentially Lamarckian, Adaptive Mutation strategy (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg, 2001</xref>; Chapter “The Efficient Lamarckian Spread of Life in the Cosmos” by Steele et al.) thereby generating in excess of 10,000 new SNP differences from the parent orbiting cosmic strain. The final step that can be envisaged is the dispersal of a successful adaptive variant in a particular region to other hospitals in that region. Thus on the basis of a Panspermic model there are two possible explanations for the strange and striking 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> patterns of genome diversity. The Lamarckian hypermutation strategy at each separate in-fall location (susceptible hospital patients) from a pure line “mother” strain is, on parsimony grounds, preferred.
