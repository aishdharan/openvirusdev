<p id="p0210">Moreover, and paradoxically, asymptomatic patients can be efficient “spreaders” of the disease. This is contrary to normal expectations as usually the infected potential spreader would display overt and full blown disease (and the coughed-up aerosols from such a patient would be dense with viral particles). Indeed, there are wide reports in the media that incubation times can range from 1 to 28 days. But once a potentially infective virus successfully navigates the Innate Immune response (see table 1, Chapter “The Efficient Lamarckian Spread of Life in the Cosmos” by Steele et al.) it would be expected to rapidly multiply within cells and spread peaking in virion numbers 5–7 days later. The actual size of the infective dose is also an important variable. So these wide-range estimates of incubation time reflect, in our view, the variable depth and extent of the 
 <italic>actual physical viral contamination</italic> in the immediate environment of a susceptible subject viz. potentially all objects in the family home environment as well as cars, bicycles, and on their bodies—hair, clothes—and other personal effects, clothes, money, keys, etc. Indeed, the external surface of the face mask may be the main carrier of the physical contamination. We explore the extent of viral environmental contamination further below.
