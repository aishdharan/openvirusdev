 <italic>Science</italic> (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2020</xref>) highlights many unusual aspects of the outbreak of COVID-19. The evidence demonstrates that many cases of disease (about 30% of case reports) arose in locations unconnected with the Wuhan seafood and meat market, and the total tally continues to increase. Phylogenetic analyses of COVID-19 (previously named nCov-2019) sequences show little by way of sequence variation thus indicating low mutation rates thus approximating closely to what would be expected for a pure culture, of a single infecting and replicating sequence affecting disease cases (

 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). These facts are now combined with the global epidemiological data, that points in the main to little or no really sustained human-to-human transmission thus far (e.g., latest reports by the Australian Department of Health). We are aware there are apparent exceptions, e.g., the “super-spreader” from Singapore, via the French Alps, and then to a United Kingdom GP surgery reporting mild symptoms, resulting in the GPs also getting the disease (
