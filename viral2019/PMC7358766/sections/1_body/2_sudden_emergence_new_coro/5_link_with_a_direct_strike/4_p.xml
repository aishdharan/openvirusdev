 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) has seen the lowest minimum for well over a century with many sunspot free days recorded in the last months of 2019. Sunspot minima are associated with a weakening of the interplanetary magnetic field near the Earth, which in turn allows easy ingress of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and electrically charged bacteria and viruses to the Earth. The mutagenic role of GCRs can cause genetic changes in already circulating viruses, but it is primarily to an enhanced flux of new infective particles released by the exploding meteoroid that we turn. Indeed a perfect storm over China is paying out before our eyes, a meteorite delivering COVID-19 particles corresponding with a very significant Sunspot Minimum cycle. It raises the important issue: How would other densely populated countries have reacted to, and handled, this event involving COVID-19? It was only the vagaries of chance that it exploded over China.
