<p id="p0345">The falling speed of spherical particles of various sizes (with a notional density 1 g cm
 <sup>− 3</sup>) through the atmosphere can be calculated as a function of height (y-axis) was calculated from formulae and data given by 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Kasten (1968)</xref>. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. A1</xref> . We note from the extreme right curve of 
 <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. A1</xref> that a particle of radius 10 μm falls through the lowest 10 km of the stratosphere at a speed of ~ 1 cm/s and so takes only a few days to cover what for smaller particles is the slowest part of their downward journey. All such particles fall comparatively rapidly through the mesosphere (z = 80–50 km), and then more and more slowly down through the stratosphere below z = 50 km. A particle with the size of a typical bacterium ~ 1 μm, falls through the lowest 10 km of the stratosphere at a speed of about 2 × 10
 <sup>− 2</sup>  cm/s and thus falls to ground in a time-scale of ~ 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>   
 <italic>s</italic>, that is about 2 years. Because there is more of the stratosphere through which such a particle must fall at high latitudes than in the tropics (the troposphere being higher in the tropics) the slow part of the journey is more extended the higher the latitude. A bacterium falling in ~ 1 year in the tropics would fall in ~ 2 years in temperate latitudes and in 2–3 years towards the poles.
