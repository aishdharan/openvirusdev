<p id="p0350">If a particle of the size of a typical virus, a particle say with a diameter of ~ 0.03 μm, fell under gravity through still air the timescale for the slowest part of the journey through the bottom 10 km of the stratosphere (z = 20–10 km) will be ~ 10
 <sup>9</sup>  s, that is about 30 years (see 
 <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. A1</xref>). This is so slow that other means of descent involving large-scale air movements in the stratosphere have to be considered. Further, the possibility of large clumps of viruses encased in cosmic dust particles will also change the relative effective sizes of infective particles and consequently their speeds of entry. We say this because … “The sophistication of viral infectivity and their 
 <italic>modus operandi</italic> of cell-cell spreading does not end here … viral genomes … can be propagated almost indefinitely (
 <xref rid="bb9605" ref-type="bibr">Combe, Garijo, Geller, Cuevas, &amp; Sanjuan, 2015</xref>) as ‘virion clusters’ of mixtures of infective and crippled genomes with significant numbers of newly minted virus particles enwrapped in protective membrane vesicles—a type of multiunit nanoparticle. This then constitutes the actual infective dose (
 <italic>or unit</italic>) rather than just a single exported virion entering a nearby target cell to cause a productive infection as is commonly believed (
