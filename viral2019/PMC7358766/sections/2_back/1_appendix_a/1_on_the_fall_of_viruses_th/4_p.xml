<p id="p0355">Thus, although in general vertical mass movements of air are feeble compared to those in the troposphere, some vertical stratospheric movement takes place despite the inhibiting effect of an inverted temperature gradient. The physical mechanism for mass stratospheric movements is the equator-to-pole temperature difference which acts as a heat engine across parallels of latitude, a heat engine that operates more strongly the larger the temperature differenceâ€”i.e., much more strongly in winter than in the summer. A similar mechanism applies also to the troposphere, where an engine crossing parallels of latitude transfers heat from tropical regions towards the poles, again more in winter than in the summer.</p>
