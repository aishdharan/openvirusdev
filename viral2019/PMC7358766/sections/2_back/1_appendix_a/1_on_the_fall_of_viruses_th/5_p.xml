<p id="p0360">Ozone measurements can be used to trace the mass movements of air in the stratosphere. Such measurements show a winter downdraft that is strongest over the latitude range 40–60 degrees. Taking advantage of this annual downdraft, individual virus particles (or dust-encased clumps) incident on the atmosphere from space would therefore reach ground-level generally in temperate latitudes, which therefore emerge from these considerations as the regions of the Earth where upper respiratory infections are likely to be most prevalent. This is true on the supposition that the Earth is smooth, which of course it is not. The exceptionally high mountains of the Himalayas on the North India-China boundary rearing up through most of the height range to the stratosphere, introduce a large perturbation to the smooth condition, which may be expected to affect adversely this particular region of the Earth, particularly China. In effect the Himalayan peaks, higher than 8 km, could act as a drain plug for most of the viruses incident on the atmosphere at latitude about 30 degrees N. The vast 1.4 billion population of China will thus be inundated by this drainage effect making China the quickest and worst affected region of the planet for cosmic pathogen-particle in-falls. As a consequence other parts of the Earth at about 30 degrees N could fortunately be largely free of incoming viral particles, unless it happens that such particles are incident as components within larger particles.</p>
