<p id="p0365">A direct proof that the winter downdraft effect in the stratosphere occurs overwhelmingly over the latitude range 40–60 degrees was demonstrated by 
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kalkstein (1961)</xref>. In the last of the series of nuclear bombs that were tested in the atmosphere, a radioactive tracer element Rh-102 was introduced into the atmosphere at a height above 100 km and the fall out of the tracer was measured month by month through airplane and balloon sampling at altitudes of ~ 20 km. The radioactive tracer Rh-102 took more than a decade to clear itself through repeated seasonal downdrafts of the kind we have described. The fall out was found to be much greater at temperate latitudes than elsewhere with the period January to March being the dominant months for the Northern Hemisphere. This is exactly similar to the pattern of incidence of influenza and other seasonal respiratory viral diseases in Northern temperate latitudes, a situation that is well-known to every medical practitioner and health authority. In the Southern hemisphere the situation is similar but 6 months displaced. This is clearly evident in 
 <xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. B1</xref> . Note that in a tropical location such as Sri Lanka no discernible seasonal effect can be detected in the data between 1968 and 1974.
