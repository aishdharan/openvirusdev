<p>The dengue‐endemic countries are at the risk of possible coinfection and coepidemics in where COVID‐19 and dengue disease are coexisting, and the viruses are cocirculating. It has appeared that several patients have been coinfected with corona and dengue virus and coepidemics have also been started in several countries. Coinfections may cause illness with overlapping signs and symptoms that make diagnosis and treatment difficult for physicians. Coepidemics of dengue and COVID‐19 have been grown as a new burden. Thus, coinfection and coepidemics trigger alert, especially in the dengue‐endemic countries where the dengue epidemic occurred repeatedly. For facing the upcoming dengue epidemic, special measures should be taken in these countries and therefore, an effective mosquito control program is strongly recommended.</p>
