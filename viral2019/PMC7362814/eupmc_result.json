    "The coronavirus family is a group of zoonotic viruses with some recognized reservoirs particularly some bats. A novel coronavirus emerged in the province of Wuhan (China) in December of 2019.The number of infected patient with serious respiratory infection quickly spread around the world to become a global pandemic. The clinical presentation and viral pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease named COVID-19 indicated that the virus is transmitted from person to person through infected droplets entering the respiratory mucosa. Close contact with infected individuals particularly in crowded environments has characterized the rapid spread of the infection. Clinical manifestations of the viral infection have mentioned the presence of some ocular findings such as conjunctival congestion, conjunctivitis and even corneal injury associated with the classical COVID-19 infection. Some animal models of different coronaviruses eye infections have described the viral pathogenesis through tear and conjunctival sampling. On the other hand, we are recommended protective measure to prevent contagion and limit the spread of the virus in health care professionals and contact lenses wearers."
