There was similarity of 91% in pangolin and 90.5 in infected bats. Homology of the genomic sequences of pangolin and 2019-nCoV were highly conserved in the protein S amino acid sequences, suggesting the pangolin as the possible intermediary host. The common trafficking of jungle animals in China, such as the pangolin, gave some credibility to this analysis.
