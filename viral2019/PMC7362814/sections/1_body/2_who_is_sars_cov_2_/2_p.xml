<p id="par0045">SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense RNA virus with a genome of 27 o 32 kb (being the largest of the RNA viruses) with a diameter of 125 nm. It has an enveloped core associated with a crown form from which it gained its name.

  <sup>11</sup>
 </xref> The virus contains in its genome a 5′ cap structure with a 3′ poly (A) tail, allowing it to act as a viral mRNA (messenger RNA), serving as a template for replication of new viral particles. A region encoding a polyprotein (pp) pp1a is found at 5′ followed by pp1b, for the encode of nonstructural proteins (NSP) involved in virus replication and a region that encodes the structural proteins as the Spike protein (S), the envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) in the 3′ region.
