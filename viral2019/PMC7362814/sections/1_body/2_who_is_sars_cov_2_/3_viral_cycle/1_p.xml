<p id="par0050">Viral entry into the host cells requires the interaction of Protein S (spike) with specific receptors on the respiratory cell. Several receptor have been identified: aminopeptidase N, (APN), dipeptydyltranferase 4 (DPP4) and the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor (ACE2) being the ACE2 the main receptor.
