<p id="par0060">Tissue samples of SARS COV have shown infection in the lung and alveolar cells primarily, but it is also apparent that cells that express the ACE 2 receptor can also replicate the virus such as the conjunctival epithelium.

 </xref> A study was recently published, they found that VeroE6 cell line expressed TMPRSS2 and inoculated with samples from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were highly susceptible to infection, demonstrating that expressing TMPRSS2 has an important role not only in understanding cell tropism, an also in the pathogenesis and therapeutic treatment against the virus.
