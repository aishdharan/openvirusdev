<p id="par0080">Coronaviruses can induce infectious symptoms in mammals and birds, different than those in humans. Several studies suggest ocular tropism in respiratory disease In murine coronavirus infection conjunctivitis, with visual alteration, was associated with retinal vasculitis and subsequent retinopathy likely all related with higher expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and declined production of Nitric Oxide (NO).
