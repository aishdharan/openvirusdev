<p id="par0130">There no evidence those multipurpose disinfectants solutions are effective in clearing the SARS-CoV-2 from the ocular surface. Antimicrobial solutions with antibacterial and antiviral efficacy are used for disinfection of contaminated fomites or other surfaces that may have been contaminated with viral particles. For instance, several studies demonstrate that solutions can give protection against viral DNA as herpes simplex virus.
