<p id="par0135">Several studies demonstrate that the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), with similar structure to SARS-CoV and Avian Influenza Virus, when they are exposed with hydrogen peroxide vapor, decreased the number of viral particles.

Despite, until the date of writing of this manuscript, it did not have information contagion of the SARS-CoV-2 from contact lenses wearers. For that reason, it could be interesting to determinate if the virus adhere to contact lenses material and how much is the quantity of the viral particle detected, in order to generate strategies and protocols in the contact lenses wearers and visual health professionals.
