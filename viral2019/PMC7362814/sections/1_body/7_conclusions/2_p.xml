<p id="par0155">Several models of viral transmission regarding the ocular structures as possible transmission routes have been described. The findings described correlated with clinical findings have only begun to open a small understanding of the ocular manifestations of COVID-19 infection. If the virus can enter through the conjunctiva it will be necessary to advise precautions in contact lenses wearing and extend the precaution about eye touching. Future investigations will determine the role of the conjunctiva and lacrimal mucosa in the pathogenesis and transmission of the virus. We invite the scientific community to set up protocols for the evaluation and testing of the ocular samples as tear and conjunctiva of suspected infections information provided by the scientific associations of visual health care professional will continue to strengthen the preventive measures to minimize the risk contagion in professional and patients.</p>
