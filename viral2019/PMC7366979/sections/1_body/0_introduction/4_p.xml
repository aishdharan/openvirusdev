<p id="par0030">Since the first whole-genome sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank accession number MN908947, also named hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 with accession ID EPI_ISL_402125 in GISAID) of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which was isolated from a 41-year old man who worked at Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, was shared online on 11 January, 2020, that first genome became the baseline for researchers to track the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it spreads around the world (
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020b</xref>). Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak and the identification of the pandemic virus, laboratories around the world are generating viral genome sequence data with unprecedented speed, researchers have sequenced and shared some 66 000 viral genomes from around the world on 14 July, 2020. Such a vast amount of available genetic data presents a unique opportunity for researchers to trace the origin and spread of COVID-19 outbreaks in different countries and gain real-time insights into the pandemic, enabling real-time progress in the understanding of the new disease and in the research and development of candidate medical countermeasures. Sequence data are essential to design and evaluate diagnostic tests, to track and trace the ongoing outbreak, and to identify potential intervention options. Therefore, tracking the accumulating nucleotide mutations in SARS-CoV-2 virusâ€™s genome as the pandemic progresses will help us better understand the pandemic and could help improve antiviral drug and vaccine effectiveness.
