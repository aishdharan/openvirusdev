<p id="par0035">In the present study, we employed state-of-the-art methods to investigate the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the virus based on 112 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains sampled from China and 12 other countries with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 9 February 2020. Rapid evolutionary and epidemiological analyses have become ever more important in response to the ongoing public health crisis in order to understand pathogenic origins, transmission dynamics, and subsequent host adaptations, and to investigate effective prevention measures for controlling pathogenic outbreaks. Our study should provide insights into the evolutionary and epidemiological histories of SARS-CoV-2 in China and elsewhere.</p>
