<p id="par0080">In conclusion, this study characterized the epidemic spread patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in China (including 10 provinces) and beyond (including 12 other countries) based on genome data generated from patients with COVID-19 between 24 December 2019 and 9 February 2020. Our results shed light on the evolutionary and epidemiological histories of SARS-CoV-2 over time, and suggest that a strategy of ‘suppression’ (e.g., social distancing of the entire population, case isolation, household quarantine, and school and university closure) is needed to reduce deaths and prevent healthcare systems being overwhelmed. Our results also emphasize the importance of using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses to provide insights into the roles of various interventions to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China and beyond. Understanding epidemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in real time is increasingly important for guiding prevention efforts.</p>
