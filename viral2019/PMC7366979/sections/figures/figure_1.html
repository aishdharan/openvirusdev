 <caption> Likelihood-mapping and split network analyses of SARS-CoV-2. Likelihood-mapping (A) and split network (B) analyses of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” are shown. For likelihood-mapping analysis, corners represent tree-like phylogenetic signals and those at sides represent network-like signals. Central area of likelihood map represents star-like signals of unresolved phylogenetic information. </caption>
