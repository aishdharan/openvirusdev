Three-generation transmission was observed. Through epidemiological investigation, we observed asymptomatic transmission to a cohabiting family member, as well as person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Wuhan city. The asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here provides evidence that there could be a greater risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread. This cluster also demonstrated that COVID-19 is transmissible during the incubation period of an asymptomatic person. Early isolation and treatment, stressing prevention of cluster outbreaks, could help prevent further spread of the epidemic.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Asymptomatic transmission</kwd><kwd>coronavirus disease 2019</kwd><kwd>Outside Wuhan</kwd><kwd>transmission and clinical characteristics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="26"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In December 2019, a series of respiratory illnesses caused by a novel coronavirus, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was detected in Wuhan city, Hubei Province of China, and this disease spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 30 March 2020, 693&#x000a0;282 patients with COVID-19 have been reported, and 33&#x000a0;106 deaths have been confirmed worldwide [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The disease is believed to be transmitted mostly via droplets or close contact, and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The typical symptoms are fever, dry cough, myalgia and fatigue [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. COVID-19 has the characteristics of rapid transmission, atypical clinical symptoms and easily affecting both lungs, leading to missed diagnoses and misdiagnoses [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>According to the &#x02018;Prevention &#x00026; Control Program for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial) 6th Edition&#x02019; enacted by China's National Health Commission [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], close contacts are defined as those who did not use effective protection and had close contact with suspected or confirmed cases 2 days before the onset of symptoms. To date, accumulated evidence has indicated person-to-person transmission to be the cause of most infections [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Li had demonstrated that person-to-person transmission occurred among close contacts since the mid-December 2019 [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The massive levels of human movement that occurred during the traditional Chinese New Year holidays fuelled the epidemic. Cases had also been reported in other provinces of China, as well as in other countries with no history of travel to Wuhan, which suggested that local person-to-person transmission was occurring in these areas. At present, a total of 42 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Dazhou, Sichuan Province, China, among which are many family cluster cases [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. With the development of the epidemic, the proportion of clustered outbreaks is increasing. Cluster outbreaks have become a major component of outbreak development throughout the country [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is important to note that while, at present, the number of new cases has recently been reduced in China, they have increased exponentially in other countries, including South Korea, Italy and the United States [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is a major threat to public health [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

A second-generation case should generally meet all of the following criteria: (1) history of contact with the first-generation case within 1&#x02212;14 days prior to disease onset; (2) no history of travel to or residence in Wuhan or its peripheries or other communities reporting any cases and (3) no history of suspected exposure, such as hospital visit, or no evident community transmission in the area where the case was located.

Case 1 developed fever and cough on 30 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, before case 1 showed any symptoms, case 4 had dinner and stayed with her mother (case 5). Cases 2&#x02013;5 were all local Dazhou residents who had no history of contact with any patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. On 1 February 2020, case 1 visited the hospital and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Dazhou CDC responded immediately and put case 1's family members (cases 2&#x02013;5) in isolation, and they underwent epidemiological investigations and nucleic acid tests. Case 2, 3 and 5 successively developed fever, cough and fatigue symptoms, and were declared positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on 4, 2 and 10 February, respectively. The nucleic acid test was also positive for case 4. however, she had no symptoms of infection, even during hospitalisation. As an asymptomatic patient, case 4 had transmitted the virus to case 5.

The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic was dominated by sporadic cases. With the expansion and spread of the virus, interpersonal and concentrated transmission has occurred in multiple communities and families across the country. With the gradual reduction of imported cases, the number of second-generation cases is increasing, especially cases of family clusters. In this study, we provide epidemiological and clinical data on a familial cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection involving five patients in Dazhou, China.</p><p>The symptoms of this novel pneumonia were non-specific. As in previous studies, fever, cough and fatigue were the most common onset symptoms [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Case 3 in this cluster had diarrhoea but no respiratory symptoms and fever. Case 4 had no symptoms during admission, which increased the difficulty of achieving the diagnosis. We speculated that, during transmission, various transmitters would cause different numbers of secondary cases and present varied severity levels of the disease. Furthermore, the immune response among patients varies due to great individual differences. Differences in clinical symptoms therefore arise. Nevertheless, these atypical initial symptoms also deserve attention similar to the more common symptoms. For instance, there have been reports of patients with COVID-19 presenting with diarrhoea as the initial symptom of illness onset [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous studies have found the levels of ESR and LDH increased in asymptomatic patients. In our study, as an asymptomatic patient, laboratory findings of case 4 had abnormalities in indicators such as raised bilirubin, ESR and slightly raised LDH. Notably, compared with symptomatic patients, these indicators soon returned to normal during our follow-up [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As with viral pneumonia due to other aetiologies, patients infected by COVID-19 show CT manifestation of GGO in the lungs [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In this familial cluster outbreak, case 1 had a history of exposure in Wuhan and could be defined as the source of infection for this outbreak. Case 3 had the onset before the primary case; thus, we can conclude that primary cases are infectious in the incubation period. Of the 3063 tourists tested for SARS-CoV-2 on the &#x02018;Diamond Princess&#x02019; 328 had been reported as having asymptomatic cases of coronavirus infection, which suggests a large number of infected individuals with no or slight symptoms [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Zou <italic>et al</italic>. had found that the viral loads of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were similar, which suggest the transmission potential of asymptomatic patients [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We further provide evidence for transmission from an asymptomatic infector to a cohabiting family member that led to COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings indicate that asymptomatic infectors could cause person-to-person transmission, and they should therefore be considered sources of COVID-19 infection. By screening close contacts with a nucleic acid test, which is the main diagnostic indicator, we could locate patients, especially asymptomatic carriers as soon as possible.</p><p>Currently, with the resumption of business and education, massive crowd, movements and hence contact, inevitably take place. Moreover, the number of imported backflow cases has also been growing, which objectively provides an opportunity for the novel coronavirus to spread. Therefore, although the confirmed cases of COVID-19 have declined, we should continue to maintain the intensity of scrutiny and investigation for potential cases, paying significant attention to the potential risk of clustering among various groups so as to prevent the domestic epidemiological trend from rising for the second time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Fanwei Zeng, Fanxin Zeng, Chun Liu, Cheng Liu, Wenlai Zhou and Lin Xu (Dazhou Central Hospital) for supporting this study.</p></ack><sec id="nts1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec><notes id="nts2" notes-type="other"><title>Data availability statements</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, S.Y., upon reasonable request.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="cite1"><collab>Organization WH</collab> (<year>2020</year>) Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report-70.
