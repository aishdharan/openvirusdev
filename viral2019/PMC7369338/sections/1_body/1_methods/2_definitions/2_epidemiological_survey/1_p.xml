<p>In reference to the Guidelines for Epidemiological Survey of Cluster Epidemic of COVID-19 (Tentative, 1st edition), a first-generation case normally refers to the earliest affected case, i.e., the first case in the cluster epidemic. A second-generation case should generally meet all of the following criteria: (1) history of contact with the first-generation case within 1âˆ’14 days prior to disease onset; (2) no history of travel to or residence in Wuhan or its peripheries or other communities reporting any cases and (3) no history of suspected exposure, such as hospital visit, or no evident community transmission in the area where the case was located. To determine a third- or later-generation case, reference can be made to the criteria for determining a second-generation case.</p>
