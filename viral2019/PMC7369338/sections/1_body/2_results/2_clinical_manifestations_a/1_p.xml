<p>To better understand the transmission characteristics of COVID-19 outside Wuhan city, we carefully clarified the contact history of each case. Case 1 was a 56-year-old woman who had a history of travel to the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, on 21–22 January 2020 (

On 22 January 2020, case 1 returned to Dazhou and stayed with her mother (case 2), daughter (case 3) and daughter-in-law (case 4) from 23 to 27 January 2020. Case 1 developed fever and cough on 30 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, before case 1 showed any symptoms, case 4 had dinner and stayed with her mother (case 5). Cases 2–5 were all local Dazhou residents who had no history of contact with any patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. On 1 February 2020, case 1 visited the hospital and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Dazhou CDC responded immediately and put case 1's family members (cases 2–5) in isolation, and they underwent epidemiological investigations and nucleic acid tests. Case 2, 3 and 5 successively developed fever, cough and fatigue symptoms, and were declared positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on 4, 2 and 10 February, respectively. The nucleic acid test was also positive for case 4. however, she had no symptoms of infection, even during hospitalisation. As an asymptomatic patient, case 4 had transmitted the virus to case 5. This cluster demonstrated the existence of a three-generation transmission chain (
