<p>At the time of admission, all the cases had abnormal chest CT findings. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>, case 1 showed multifocal ground-glass opacity (GGO), predominantly involving subpleural regions of both lung CT scans. Case 2 showed patchy GGO of both lungs. Cases 3 and 5 showed multifocal GGO, especially around the outer bands of the lungs on CT scans, which were compatible with changes observed in viral pneumonia. Case 4 had no clinical symptoms, but chest CT showed patchy GGO in the right upper lobe. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, all the cases had normal or reduced white blood cell counts, and cases 2â€“5 developed lymphocytopenia, which was consistent with the main characteristic of viral infection. In terms of inflammation indicators, all the patients on admission presented an elevated serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but no elevated C-reactive protein or procalcitonin. Case 4 had higher levels of bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The other laboratory test results did not show significant abnormalities.
