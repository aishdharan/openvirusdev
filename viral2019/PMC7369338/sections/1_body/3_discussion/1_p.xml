 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic was dominated by sporadic cases. With the expansion and spread of the virus, interpersonal and concentrated transmission has occurred in multiple communities and families across the country. With the gradual reduction of imported cases, the number of second-generation cases is increasing, especially cases of family clusters. In this study, we provide epidemiological and clinical data on a familial cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection involving five patients in Dazhou, China.
