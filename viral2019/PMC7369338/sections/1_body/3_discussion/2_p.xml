<p>The symptoms of this novel pneumonia were non-specific. As in previous studies, fever, cough and fatigue were the most common onset symptoms [

 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Case 3 in this cluster had diarrhoea but no respiratory symptoms and fever. Case 4 had no symptoms during admission, which increased the difficulty of achieving the diagnosis. We speculated that, during transmission, various transmitters would cause different numbers of secondary cases and present varied severity levels of the disease. Furthermore, the immune response among patients varies due to great individual differences. Differences in clinical symptoms therefore arise. Nevertheless, these atypical initial symptoms also deserve attention similar to the more common symptoms. For instance, there have been reports of patients with COVID-19 presenting with diarrhoea as the initial symptom of illness onset [
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous studies have found the levels of ESR and LDH increased in asymptomatic patients. In our study, as an asymptomatic patient, laboratory findings of case 4 had abnormalities in indicators such as raised bilirubin, ESR and slightly raised LDH. Notably, compared with symptomatic patients, these indicators soon returned to normal during our follow-up [
