<p>In this familial cluster outbreak, case 1 had a history of exposure in Wuhan and could be defined as the source of infection for this outbreak. Case 3 had the onset before the primary case; thus, we can conclude that primary cases are infectious in the incubation period. Of the 3063 tourists tested for SARS-CoV-2 on the ‘Diamond Princess’ 328 had been reported as having asymptomatic cases of coronavirus infection, which suggests a large number of infected individuals with no or slight symptoms [

 <italic>et al</italic>. had found that the viral loads of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were similar, which suggest the transmission potential of asymptomatic patients [

These findings indicate that asymptomatic infectors could cause person-to-person transmission, and they should therefore be considered sources of COVID-19 infection. By screening close contacts with a nucleic acid test, which is the main diagnostic indicator, we could locate patients, especially asymptomatic carriers as soon as possible.
