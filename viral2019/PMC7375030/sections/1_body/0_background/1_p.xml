Scientists in China were able to quickly identify that the new coronavirus, which was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), was responsible for the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) [

However, after numerous efforts by the Chinese government, public health agencies, and clinicians, the epidemic curve of the new cases in China peaked on February 12â€“13, after which it began to decline, suggesting that the number of new cases was falling [
 <xref rid="b7-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Now, the number of new daily cases is lower than the number of daily discharged cases in China. Imaging plays an important role in the management of COVID-19. This paper aims to provide a timely review of various imaging modalities in use in the diagnosis and treatment process of COVID-19, including chest radiographs, computerized tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound examination, and positron emission tomography (PET/CT) scan.
