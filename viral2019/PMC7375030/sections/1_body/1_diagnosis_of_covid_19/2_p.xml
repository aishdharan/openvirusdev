<p>RT-PCR is recognized as the criterion standard for the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, but it produces many false-negative results. In the detection of COVID-19 infection, lower-respiratory tract samples have higher diagnostic value than upper-respiratory tract samples [
 <xref rid="b9-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but lower-respiratory tract sampling (e.g., using alveolar lavage fluid) is difficult. Sampling errors and low viral load limit the accuracy of RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="b10-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, it is time-consuming and a shortage of viral testing kits due to the epidemic also limit the application of RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="b11-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some patients may be unable to get timely diagnosis and treatment in the early stage, which may increase the spread of the epidemic. Therefore, some Chinese experts recommend use of imaging in the diagnosis of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="b12-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which allows early identification, isolation, and intervention for infected patients, which could help control the sources of infection and reduce the infection rate.
