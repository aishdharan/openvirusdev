<p>Chest CT examination, especially chest CT volume scanning with thin-layer reconstruction, is currently being used as the first-line imaging modality in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in China [

 <xref rid="b20-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The most commonly reported CT findings in COVID-19 include: (1) GGOs, consolidation, or both, with a peripheral and basal distribution in the bilateral lungs and often with reticular interlobular septal thickening (known as crazy-paving pattern) (

Epidemiological history and clinical manifestations were more helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in children versus chest CT [
