<p>It is important to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia (such as influenza pneumonia, parainfluenza pneumonia, SARS and adenovirus pneumonia), mycoplasma pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia. CT manifestations of bacterial pneumonia are patchy shadows distributed along the bronchi, which can be merged into a large-lobe lesion or consolidation. Coupled with the increase in white blood cells, laboratory tests can be used to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia [

 <xref rid="b26-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Compared with non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution GGOs and reticular interlobular septal thickening, but less likely to have central distributions, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy [

Travel or residence in Wuhan or close contact with confirmed/suspected patients can provide an essential clue for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The diagnosis must be confirmed by nucleic acid testing or viral gene sequencing.
