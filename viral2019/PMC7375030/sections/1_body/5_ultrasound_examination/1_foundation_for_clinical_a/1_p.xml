<p>Ultrasound is one of the most commonly used imaging modalities in clinical practice, providing systematic and rapid examinations of multiple organs at the bedside without use of radiation. Initially, ultrasound was thought to be incapable of detecting lung lesions. However, since the 1990s, lung ultrasound has been applied in a wide range of clinically critical conditions [

 <xref rid="b43-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, deeply located lung lesions cannot be detected by ultrasound, and it is difficult for ultrasound to be used in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia. Ultrasound is not recommended in the diagnosis of mild cases. It can be used as a supplementary method in pulmonary and cardiac evaluation, especially in critically ill patients who should not be moved and for whom CT examination is impossible [
