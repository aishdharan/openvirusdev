<p>Secondly, respiratory support is essential in severe and critical cases, but the time point to switch from noninvasive ventilation to invasive mechanical ventilation is a major issue among clinicians [

Lung ultrasound showing progressive diffuse fusion B-line and the presence of significantly enhanced diaphragm activity can be an indication of severe lung damage. Combined with the oxygenation index, shifting from noninvasive ventilation to invasive mechanical ventilation is likely to occur earlier [
 <xref rid="b50-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. After invasive ventilation, ultrasound can help monitor the process of lung recruitment maneuver while preventing lung injuries caused by mechanical ventilation [
 <xref rid="b51-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Weaning is a critical part of mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-infected patients. Systematic ultrasound evaluation of lung, heart, and diaphragm function before and after weaning can help to avoid weaning failure or even re-injury caused by failed extubation, which can reduce the mortality rate and the risk of medical staff infection [
 <xref rid="b52-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. When mechanical ventilation cannot improve oxygenation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be a treatment option [
 <xref rid="b53-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Ultrasound enables visual management in the process of ECMO.
