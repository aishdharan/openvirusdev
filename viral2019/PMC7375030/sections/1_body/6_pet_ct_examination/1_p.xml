 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT is not recommended for routine diagnosis in emergency settings, but in early-stage COVID-19, PET/CT has potential clinical utility in the differential diagnosis of complex cases. A case series illustrated the PET/CT findings of patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 infection [
 <xref rid="b58-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The study reported that all patients had peripheral GGOs and/or lung consolidations in multiple pulmonary lobes. Pulmonary lesions were characterized by high 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake, which reflected the inflammatory burden. It is similar to PET/CT images of respiratory syndrome and MERS coronaviruses infections [

 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptakes were higher in involved lymph nodes, which was not revealed by other imaging modalities [

 <xref rid="b61-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. There were no disseminated lesions in other body parts, indicating that this coronavirus exhibited pulmonary tropism. It was also reported that PET/CT lung ventilation and perfusion scanning can provide accurate imaging of regional lung function [
