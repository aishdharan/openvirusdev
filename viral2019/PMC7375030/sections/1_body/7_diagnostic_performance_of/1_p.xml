<p>The reported sensitivities and specificities of CT in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia varied from 67–98% and 24–94%, respectively [

 <xref rid="b66-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. As reported by Raptis et al., the sensitivities may be overestimated by patient selection bias and the lack of detailed definition of positive CT findings [
 <xref rid="b67-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The specificities may also be overestimated due to the lack of singular image features unique to COVID-19 and lack of objective criteria for the definition of positive CT results [
 <xref rid="b64-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. There is little research on the diagnostic performance of detecting various stages of COVID-19 infection. However, a recent study showed the sensitivity and specificity of CT visual quantitative analysis in diagnosing severe-critical cases were 82.6% and 100%, respectively, indicating its potential to reflect the clinical classification of COVID-19 [
