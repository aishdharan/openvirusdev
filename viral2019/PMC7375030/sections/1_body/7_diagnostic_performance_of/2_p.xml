<p>Regarding the diagnostic performance of lung ultrasonography, the ultrasound scores in diagnosis of mild, moderate, and severe lung lesions exhibited a sensitivity of 68.8%, 77.8%, and 100.0%, a specificity of 85.7%, 76.2%, and 92.9%, and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7%, 76.7%, and 93.3%, respectively [
 <xref rid="b69-medscimonit-26-e924582" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These results indicate that ultrasound diagnostic efficacy is relatively low for mild to moderate cases but high for severe cases. There is no relevant research reported on the diagnostic performance of chest radiography and PET/CT examination.
