<p>In summary, this paper compares various imaging modalities being used in the management of COVID-19 in China. The advantage and disadvantage of each imaging modality in detecting lesions can be summarized as below: (1) Chest radiography shows no abnormalities in early-stage COVID-19 but could be used as a screening tool in patients who are not allowed to be transferred for CT examination; (2) Chest CT is a reliable, fast, and practical imaging modality for management of COVID-19 in China, although the financial cost and repeated exposure to ionizing radiation should be considered; (3) Deeply located lung lesions cannot be detected by ultrasound, but it could be used in critically ill patients to assess cardiorespiratory function, help in respiratory support, and identify the presence of deep venous thrombosis; and (4) PET/CT provides supplementary information beyond that provided by other imaging modalities. It is important to exploit the advantages of various imaging modalities in the fight against COVID-19.</p>
