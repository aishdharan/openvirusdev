 </xref> Considering the outbreak of coronavirus and dengue reaching their peak simultaneously, the ill equipped health care system in Pakistan requires stringent interventions on emergency grounds. Despite the limited available resources, Pakistan is trying hard to contain COVID-19 outbreak through lockdowns of highly-infected areas, contact tracing and ban on social gatherings. In the current scenario, under-reporting of COVID-19 cases is expected owing to lack of testing facilities, trained laboratory professionals and limited surveillance networks for active case search. Considering Pakistan as an endemic country for rash associated viral infections such as dengue, chikungunya, rubella and other vaccine preventable diseases like measles, a battery of diagnostic testing should be considered for perfect diagnosis of COVID-19 and related viral infections with temporal coincidence and outbreak potential.
