<p id="para0005">A 37-year-old male without any medical history presented with a 2-day history of dyspnea and fatigue. He was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab. Physical examination revealed no evidence of swelling or tenderness of his extremities. He was subsequently intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. His-pertinent labs are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> . His-creatine kinase (CK) on admission was 17,000 and peaked at 35,000 IU/L. Inflammatory markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), white blood cell count (WBC), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were markedly elevated since his admission. He was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and hydrated aggressively with intravenous fluids. He required renal replacement therapy (RRT) on day five of hospitalization due to poor urine output and worsening AHRF. No other predisposing factors for rhabdomyolysis were identified, such as drugs, toxins, electrolyte abnormalities, or other infections. He died 12-days later despite therapies involving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma.
