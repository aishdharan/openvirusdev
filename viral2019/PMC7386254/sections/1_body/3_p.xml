<p id="para0006">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family of coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2003 epidemic. A case series of SARS-CoV-related rhabdomyolysis showed the development of AKI with peak CK levels ranging from 7500 to 340,000 IU/L.

 </xref> Jin and colleagues were the first to describe a 60-year-old man who was admitted with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and developed rhabdomyolysis on day 9th of hospital admission. His-renal function was within normal limits, and his peak laboratory values of CK, LDH, and CRP were markedly elevated at 12,000 IU/L, 2347 IU/L, and 206â€¯mg/L, respectively.

 </xref> He did not develop AKI and improved with hydration and supportive care. Peak CK has been shown to have a poor correlation with the incidence of AKI, where a retrospective study on influenza-related rhabdomyolysis showed 82% of patients developed AKI with peak CK 20,000 IU/L and less.

 </xref> Rhabdomyolysis can be the initial presentation or occur at any time during the SARS-CoV-2 disease course. Clinicians should be aware that although aggressive fluid administration has been frequently applied to prevent AKI in rhabdomyolysis, SARS-CoV-2 patients are at risk of developing worsening ARHF from fluid overload, especially in the setting of AKI with oliguria.
