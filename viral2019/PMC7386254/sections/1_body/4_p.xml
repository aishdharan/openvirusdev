<p id="para0007">Generalized muscle pain and fatigue are common presenting symptoms in SARS-CoV-2. However, this can be difficult to assess in critically ill patients, especially when they are intubated and sedated on a mechanical ventilator. Unlike other inflammatory markers

A retrospective study of 171 SARS-CoV-2 patients showed that CK of more than 185 IU/L, AKI, and requirement of RRT was associated with an increase in mortality.

 <sc>d</sc>-dimer, ferritin, and procalcitonin. This may suggest a connection between excessive immune cytokine response leading to rhabdomyolysis and AKI. We postulate that the possible etiologies of SARS-CoV-2-related rhabdomyolysis could be 1) direct viral invasion of muscles, 2) release of viral-toxins causing myositis, or 3) overwhelming immune response to the virus leading to cytokine storm with resulting myositis.
