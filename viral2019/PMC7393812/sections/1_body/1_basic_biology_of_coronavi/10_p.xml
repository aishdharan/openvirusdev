<p id="Par12">While expression of most major coronavirus receptors may not be significant in adult human brain parenchyma, another consideration for viral neurotropism is the fact that viruses commonly exploit alternate receptors to gain cell access, albeit with lesser efficiency. For example, human CD209L (L-SIGN), expressed on endothelial cells of liver and lymph node and also on primary isolated human brain microvascular endothelia, can act as a receptor for SARS-CoV (Jeffers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2004</xref>; Mukhtar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2002</xref>). It is currently unclear if SARS-CoV-2 is capable of exploiting L-SIGN, and alternate receptor mechanisms are not thoroughly investigated for HCoVs; only receptor motifs are available for two human species (OC43 and HKU1) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A clinical isolate of one of those species, HCoV-OC43-Paris, can infect murine olfactory bulbs with dissemination throughout brain; the cell receptor mediating this neurovirulence is unknown (St-Jean et al.
