<p id="Par13">It is also important to recognize that direct infection of neurons, glia, and/or olfactory neuroepithelia is not a necessary predicate for neuropathogenesis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition to direct parenchymal infection, mechanisms that can contribute to CNS damage are direct infection of endothelial cells; increased thrombophilia with vascular occlusion in the absence of direct infection; para-infectious immune-mediated damage as in acute disseminated necrotizing or demyelinating encephalopathy; and in the course of inflammatory cell migration across the blood–brain and blood–CSF barriers, meningoencephalitis. Many viruses gain access to the CNS via immune cell trafficking across the blood–brain and blood–CSF barriers.
