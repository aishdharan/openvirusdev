<p id="Par3">Coronaviruses are a large and expanding family of membrane-enveloped, positive sense, single-strand RNA viruses, with genomes ranging in molecular weight from 25 to 32 kb. They are roughly 120 to 140 nm in diameter, inclusive of spike (S) proteins that protrude from their envelopes to a height of approximately 20 nm, producing the corona-like appearance on electron microscopy (EM) that gives the family its name. An excellent review of the viral and cellular biology of coronaviruses can be found in Fields Virology (Perlman and Masters, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2020</xref>). Within the subfamily Coronavirinae, there are four genuses—alpha, beta, gamma, and delta—defined by intra-genus conservation of seven domains in the viral replicase/transcriptase; within each genus, species are defined by a minimum of 90% amino acid sequence homology in these conserved regions (Perlman and Masters
