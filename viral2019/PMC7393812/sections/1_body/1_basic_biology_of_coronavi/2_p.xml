<p id="Par4">Currently, with one exception, mammalian coronaviruses are members of the alpha and beta genuses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The global distribution of coronavirus species is “driven” by bat populations, which constitute the major viral reservoir. In regions of the world where bats are highly diverse, such as portions of Asia and Africa, host switching is the dominant mechanism of viral evolution (Anthony et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). Thus, zoonotic transmission to man has higher likelihood in these geographic areas, as host switching is its predicate. There are currently seven known human coronaviruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); almost all have zoonotic origins, or are known to circulate in animals (Anthony et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>; Andersen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). Animal surveillance has been suggested as a useful technique in combatting epidemic viruses: for example, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in domestic cats, with transmission from infected to uninfected cats occurring through respiratory droplets (Martina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2003</xref>; Shi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2020</xref>). As these common pets may be in community as well as in close contact with their owners at home, they may conceivably provide an adjunctive mechanism for virus tracking.
