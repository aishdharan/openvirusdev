<p id="Par5">Canonical features of coronaviruses include a large RNA molecule with 5′ capping and polyadenylated tail and an invariant order of major genes encoding (from 5′ to 3′): the replicase/transcriptase complex–spike (S) protein–envelope (E) protein–membrane (M) protein–nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S, E, and M proteins are embedded in the viral envelope, with M being most abundant, whereas N is the sole protein of the helical viral nucleocapsid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As the genome is capped and polyadenylated, it is ready for translation once introduced into cell cytoplasm. Dependent upon viral species, a variety of smaller open reading frames (ORFs) for accessory genes are found within intergenic regions of the structural proteins. In a subset of betacoronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine CoV, and human viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1), a fifth major protein, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), may be encoded. The HE protein, expressed on the viral membrane envelope, is capable of binding sialic acid residues on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids and has acetylesterase activity; it is a close relative of the influenza C virus HE and is thought to reflect a shared common ancestor (Perlman and Masters

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1992</xref>). Importantly, through adaptation to human infection, the HEs found in HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 are thought to have lost their receptor/lectin binding functions (Bakkers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>). The HE protein is not found in SARS viruses.
