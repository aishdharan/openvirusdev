<p id="Par7">The major cell receptors for epidemic human coronaviruses are for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and for MERS, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For continuously circulating human species, HCoV-NL63 uses the ACE2 receptor, and neutralizing antibodies to HCoV-NL63 have been found in virtually all adults (Hofmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2005</xref>). Furthermore, HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV recognize the same motifs in ACE2 with their receptor binding domains (Perlman and Masters 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2020</xref>). While sharing a common receptor, characteristics of viralâ€“host cell interactions vary between species: SARS-CoV binds and downregulates ACE2 with greater efficiency than HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates even greater binding efficiency for ACE2 than SARS-CoV (Hofmann et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2020</xref>). HCoV-229E uses aminopeptidase N (APN, also known as CD13) as its major receptor, and binding motifs for HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 are
