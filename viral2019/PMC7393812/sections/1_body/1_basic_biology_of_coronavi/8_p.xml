<p id="Par10">In contrast, DPP4 (also known as T cell activation antigen CD26) can more confidently be localized to human CNS in an age-dependent manner and is a protein implicated in immunologic signaling, processing/inactivation of neuropeptides, and glucose homeostasis. It is the target for inhibition by gliptin therapies in diabetes, which are also in trial for dementia and stroke (Wicinski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2019</xref>). The DPP4 protein has been detected in abundance in human fetal and perinatal brains and in neuroblasts and neurons, capillaries, ependyma, and choroid plexus (Bernstein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1987</xref>). With maturation, its expression decreases and, in adult brain, appears largely confined to vascular structures; this is in contrast to a study in normal mice, which detected protein in cortical astrocytes (Bernstein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1987</xref>; Mentzel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1996</xref>). Only small amounts of DPP4 mRNA are detected in adult human brain relative to other tissues such as the placenta, kidney, lung, and liver (Abbott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1994</xref>). Detection in brain parenchyma is also described in human disease: in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), DPP4 is upregulated in microglia of normal appearing white matter, whereas within MS plaque, expression is in monocytes/macrophages (Elkjaer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2019</xref>). One report of increased DPP4 in neurons and plaques of Alzheimerâ€™s disease is published, but is restricted to immunohistochemical analysis without other means of confirmation (Bernstein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>).
