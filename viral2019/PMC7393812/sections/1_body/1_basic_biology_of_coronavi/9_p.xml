<p id="Par11">Whereas ACE2 and DPP4 are primarily vascular in the healthy adult human brain, strong expression of APN (CD13) is seen both in mature brain parenchyma and vasculature (Larrinaga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2005</xref>; Smyth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2018</xref>). In cerebral cortex, APN activity can be isolated in diverse subcellular fractions, including nuclei and synaptic membranes; the protein is a component of the system regulating neuropeptide activity (Larrinaga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2005</xref>). In brain vasculature, APN is a marker of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (Smyth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2018</xref>). APN has also been identified in primary cultures of human olfactory neuroepithelia, which by virtue of their location offer a potential CNS portal for respiratory viruses (Vawter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">1996</xref>). It is currently hypothesized, but not proven, that transaxonal spread from infected olfactory neuroepithelium is a CNS portal for HCoVs, as has been described in animal models of diverse viral pathogens and in SARS-HCoV-infected hACE2 transgenic mice (Van Riel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>; McCray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2007</xref>). Finally, the human brain contains the highest concentration of sialic acids of any organ, found predominantly as sialoglycolipids (Wang and Brand-Miller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2003</xref>; Schnaar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2014</xref>). 
 <italic>O</italic>-Acetylated forms constitute several percent of total brain gangliosides, although 9-
 <italic>O</italic> forms may be specific for neurogenesis and migrating neuroblasts and, thus, not generally available for binding in adults (Schnaar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2014</xref>).
