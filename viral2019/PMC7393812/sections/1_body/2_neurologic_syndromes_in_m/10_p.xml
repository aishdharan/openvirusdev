<p id="Par24">An altered sense of smell or taste has been reported in up to 87% of adults testing positive for SARS-CoV-2; the prevalence may be higher in European studies than in those from Asia (Spinato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2020</xref>; Eliezer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>; Lechien et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>; Mao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>). In Europe, olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is the presenting symptom in approximately 12% of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 and has been suggested as a useful screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 (Spinato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2020</xref>; Lechien et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>; Wee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>). However, olfactory dysfunction is not unique to epidemic coronaviruses; this is a well-known post-viral phenomenon for other respiratory viruses, and in one study, HCoV-229E was identified as an underlying pathogen (Suzuki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2007</xref>). When contrasted with historical influenza patients, one study found a greater frequency of smell and taste disorders with COVID-19 (Beltran-Corbellini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). The pathogenesis of this phenomenon for any respiratory virus is unclear, but it is of interest that nasal epithelial cells have robust expression of ACE2. Similarly, the CNS relevance of this phenomenon is unresolved. Neuroimaging of patients with post-viral olfactory loss has demonstrated decreased olfactory cortex and olfactory bulb volumes, implicating CNS damage; it is unclear whether similar phenomena will be observed with the epidemic coronaviruses (Yao et al.
