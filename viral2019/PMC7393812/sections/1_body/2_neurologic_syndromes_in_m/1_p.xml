<p id="Par15">Neurologic manifestations have been recorded for all currently recognized HCoVs, impacting a wide age range; not surprisingly, the spectrum of disease in infants and children differs from that in adults (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In interpreting the literature, it is essential to distinguish encephalopathy in the setting of systemic infection from infectious encephalitis, as per the International Encephalitis Consortium guidelines (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) (Venkatesan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2013</xref>). Coronavirus encephalitis is so infrequent in infants, children, and adults, that it is not mentioned as a differential diagnosis in any consensus diagnostic algorithm or treatment protocol for, or in any large-scale survey of, viral encephalitis (Venkatesan et al.

It is unclear why encephalitis is so infrequent in man, when other naturally occurring coronaviruses in animals may frequently display inflammatory CNS pathology; for example, encephalitis is commonly seen with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), one of the most prevalent and fatal pathogens of cats (Rissi
