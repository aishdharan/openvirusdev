<p id="Par16">In infants and children worldwide, respiratory viruses are the most common infectious pathogens, and lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death (Dominguez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>; Carman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>). The contribution of coronaviruses to respiratory infections is inconstant, as the seroepidemiology for HCoVs NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43 varies widely, ranging from 1 to 75%, dependent on viral species, patient age, geographic location, care venue, and time of year (Principi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2010</xref>). Coronaviruses can be serious pathogens when encountered in infancy and childhood; in a series of children under the age of 16 hospitalized in Hunan Province, coronaviruses accounted for 11% of respiratory infections (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2016b</xref>). A study from the Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Colorado estimated 40% of tests for prevalent respiratory pathogens were non-diagnostic (for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and adenovirus), when re-tested, 5% yielded coronaviruses (44% NL63, 40% OC43, 13% 229E, 2% HKU1) (Dominguez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>).
