<p id="Par18">Acute meningoencephalitis or meningitis is another complication of coronaviruses in infants and children, albeit rare. A 3-year-old with meningitis in the setting of HCoV-OC43 serology may be the first case described in the literature; another case report of HCoV-OC43 encephalitis in an 11-month-old boy with immunodeficiency was published 36 years later (Riski and Hovi

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2016</xref>). The only series to date describing features of coronavirus-associated encephalitis is from the Children’s Hospital of Chenzhou in Hunan Province (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2016b</xref>). Of 183 children under the age of 16 years admitted for acute encephalitis, 22 (12%) had coronavirus infection detected by IgM serology (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2016b</xref>). Eighty-two percent of these children were male, and the mean age was 3 years. The course of disease averaged 14.5 days, and all had a full recovery with no neurological sequelae. Fever was present in 82%, headache in 46%, vomiting in 36%, and seizure in 23%. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was seen in 46%, normal CSF glucose in 82%, and elevated protein in 36%. When compared to children hospitalized with pulmonary coronavirus, children with encephalitis had lower peripheral blood lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, higher neutrophil counts, and higher serum levels of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Children with encephalitis also had higher peripheral blood monocyte counts than healthy controls. When paired biospecimens were analyzed, levels of GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 were higher in the CSF than in the serum of the encephalitic children (Li et al.
