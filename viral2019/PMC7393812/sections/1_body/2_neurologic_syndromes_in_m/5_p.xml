<p id="Par19">Non-specific neurologic manifestations such as lethargy, dizziness, and headache are also described in children with SARS-related respiratory illness, but there is insufficient evidence to ascribe signs and symptoms to a viral CNS effect, as opposed to constitutional symptoms of severe respiratory compromise (Hon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2003</xref>; Bitnun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>; Chiu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>). Recently, infants under the age of 3Â months with COVID-19, presenting with non-focal neurologic phenomena (axial hypotonia, drowsiness) with isolated fever and without respiratory illness, have been described (Nathan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2020</xref>). Cerebrospinal fluid in all was normal and negative for SARS-CoV-2; all recovered with only acetaminophen therapy. It has been noted that constitutional symptoms with SARS are more frequent in teenagers than in children under 12 and resemble the symptoms seen in adults (Ng et al.
