<p id="Par20">Non-specific neurologic manifestations have also been reported in the more severe COVID-19-associated pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (Riphagen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>; Chiotos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). This emerging syndrome resembles Kawasaki disease, with persistent fevers, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiac and coronary abnormalities. In one report, symptoms and signs seen in 4 of 6 children with this severe illness included headache, altered mental status, irritability, and nuchal rigidity (Chiotos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). One child displayed cerebral edema on head CT, and lumbar puncture revealed a pleocytosis consistent with aseptic leptomeningitis. While viral testing of CSF for SARS-CoV-2 was not described, this may represent the first case of meningoencephalitis in a child with COVID-19 disease.
