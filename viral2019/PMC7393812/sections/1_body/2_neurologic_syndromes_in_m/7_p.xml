<p id="Par21">While continuously circulating coronaviruses account for most CNS manifestations in infants and children, the majority of brain abnormalities in adults have been described with the epidemic coronaviruses. In adults, neurologic manifestations most frequently described are non-focal, non-specific, and unaccompanied by direct evidence of CNS viral invasion and hence the debate as to whether they are intrinsically neurologic or constitutional. Furthermore, even when neurologic signs confirm diffuse intracerebral pathology, it is unclear whether this reflects damage mediated by virus, or by the severe hypoxia and cytokine storms encountered in COVID-19, SARS, and MERS disease. Finally, peripheral nervous system (PNS) and musculoskeletal abnormalities are described in adults with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections; while not the focus of this review, these include Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, isolated multiple cranial neuropathy, and Miller Fisher syndrome (Gutierrez-Ortiz et al.
