<p id="Par27">Direct evidence of HCoV-OC43 neurovirulence was found in the brain biopsy of an infant with severe combined immunodeficiency who developed fatal encephalitis (Morfopoulou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2016</xref>). HCoV-OC43 was detected by RNA sequencing and real-time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry for the viral N protein showed dark staining of neuronal perikarya and lighter staining of surrounding neuropil, with frequent neuronal karyorrhexis, while microglial proliferation and infiltrating T cells were seen in the biopsy, depicted regions with viral antigen staining appeared devoid of lymphoid inflammation or neuronophagia. Productive neuronal infection with apoptosis and persistent neurologic deficit has been described with HCoV-OC43 infection of mice, and axonal transport with neuron-to-neuron propagation has been identified as a mode of virus spreading in cell culture (Jacomy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>; Dube et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>). Thus, while coronavirus encephalitis may be rare, it is possible that a cellular inflammatory response is not prominent with neuronal necrosis, hampering clinical recognition; murine models highlight the role of selective neuronal damage in neurovirulence.
