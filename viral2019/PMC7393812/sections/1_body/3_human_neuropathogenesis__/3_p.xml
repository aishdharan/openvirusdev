<p id="Par28">Limited studies of the CSF and brain have also been performed for the epidemic coronaviruses. SARS-CoV has been detected in the CSF of patients who develop seizures in the context of pulmonary disease; in both cases reported, there was a normal CSF protein and no CSF pleocytosis (Lau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2004</xref>; Hung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2003</xref>). Viral loads were quantified in one patient, with the CSF yielding 6884 copies/ml and the serum 6750 copies/ml, strongly supportive of CNS infection (Hung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2003</xref>). In contrast, mononuclear pleocytosis was present in a patient with altered sensorium and seizures with SARS-CoV-2 detected in CSF; in this patient, virus was not detected in a nasopharyngeal swab, and post-seizure neuroimaging demonstrated hyperintensities in the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and lateral ventricle (Moriguchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2020</xref>). While MERS patients with seizures have been described, CSF studies are not available (Saad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2014</xref>). In MERS and COVID-19 patients who are without seizures, the few reported CSF studies have been negative, raising the possibility that seizure activity might be an indicator of CNS viral penetrance and neuronal damage (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017</xref>; Helms et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>). However, data from CSF studies is too limited to draw conclusions.
