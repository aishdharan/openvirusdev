  <p>Cell entry pathways utilized by coronaviruses. Coronaviruses enter cell cytoplasm via two receptor-mediated pathways that require proteolytic processing of the S protein; this priming exposes the S2 domain, which participates in membrane fusion and allows injection of viral genome into the cell. The “early pathway” occurs exclusively at the cell membrane, and the “late pathway” entails viral internalization via clathrin-coated pits that transition to acidified endosomes. In the late pathway, S antigen priming occurs both at the cell membrane (via proteases such as TMPRSS2 and furin), as well as in the endosome, utilizing endosomal proteases (cathepsins) and potentially furin. Therapies that interfere with acidification of the endosome, such as hydroxychloroquine, interfere with this pathway. In the early pathway, viral binding to the receptor and proteolytic processing of the S protein are accomplished entirely by proteases at the cell surface, which allows direct entry of the viral genome into cytoplasm.</p>
