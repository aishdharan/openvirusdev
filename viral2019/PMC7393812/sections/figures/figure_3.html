 <caption> COVID-19-associated microangiopathy in the brain. This high-power photomicrograph displays a small blood vessel in cerebral white matter of a patient dying with COVID-19 disease. A small fibrin thrombus is seen, and monocyte margination consistent with “endotheliitis” as has been described in systemic vasculature. This patient had infarcts and hemorrhages; these findings were the most common abnormalities in the largest neuropathology series described to date (Bryce et al. 2020). (Hematoxylin and eosin stain, original magnification 200×) </caption>
