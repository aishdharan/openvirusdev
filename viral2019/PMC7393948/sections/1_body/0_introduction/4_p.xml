<p>The full length of the ORF3 gene is 675 bp, encoding 224 amino acids. The PEDV ORF3 gene has been found to have a low sequence conservation through analysis of the amino acid sequences and their homologs across the alpha-coronavirus genus (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The ORF3 encodes an ion channel protein and regulates virus production (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and its naturally truncated form might cause attenuation of the virus to the natural host. The differentiation of ORF3 could be a marker of adaptation to cell cultures and attenuation of virus, and this could be a valuable tool for studying the molecular epidemiology of PEDV (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). To investigate the genetic diversity of PEDV in Guangxi, we sequenced the full-length ORF3 gene of 33 PEDV positive field samples collected from 2017 to 2019.
