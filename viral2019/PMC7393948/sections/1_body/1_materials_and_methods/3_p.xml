<p>Total RNA was extracted using a humoral virus DNA/RNA kit (Axygen Scientific, Union City, CA, USA), and transcribed into cDNA by Oligo dTs, dNTP mix, and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The primers, ORF3F: 5′-GTCCTAGACTTCAACCTTACGAAG-3′ and ORF3R: 5′-AACTACTAGACCATTATCATTCAC-3′ were used for PCR at 95°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min (
