<p>The RT-PCR products were analyzed using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ultraviolet illumination. The expected DNA band was purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (OMEGA biotech, Doraville, GA, USA), and cloned into a pMD-18T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The sequences of the positive clones were determined by Beijing Genomics Institute (Guangzhou, China). The validated genome sequences of ORF3 were submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers MK895557~MK895560 and MN518432~MN518465.</p>
