<p>One-hundred and thirteen reference strains of PEDV ORF3 from different countries collected on different dates were selected for the genetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Sequences were analyzed by using software packages, DNAstar, MEGA5.2, and iTOL v.5. Multiple nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were analyzed by applying the ClustalV method with the MegAlign program and the ClustalW alignment tool in the MEGA5.2 software, respectively. The MEGA 5.2 program was applied to construct phylogenetic trees by using the neighbor-joining method, the tree topology was constructed using the Poisson model and the robustness of the phylogenetic tree was evaluated by bootstrapping using 1,000 replicates (
