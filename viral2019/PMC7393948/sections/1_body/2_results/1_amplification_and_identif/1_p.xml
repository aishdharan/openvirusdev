<p>The ORF3 gene was amplified using the primer pair for ORF3 from generated cDNA, and one distinct band of unexpected shorter sizes was observed in five PCR products in addition to the predicted band. Both bands of nucleotide were cloned into a pMD-18T vector and were identified by enzyme digestion using
