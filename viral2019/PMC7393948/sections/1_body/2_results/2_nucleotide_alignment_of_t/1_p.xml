<p>In this study, thirty-eight strains of PEDV ORF3 were obtained from 33 samples in Guangxi between 2017 and 2019 (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There were five strains (CHN/GXNN-4-2/2018, CHN/GXQZ-3-2/2018, CHN/GXQZ-6-2/2018, CHN/GXLB-1-2/2019 and CHN/GXQZ-1-2/2019) of ORF3 which were only 293bp in length, and the rest of the 33 strains had a complete ORF3 gene sequence, with a length of 675 bp. When these five Guangxi naturally truncated strains were compared with the main reference strains for nucleotide alignment (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we found that the five strains all had continuous deletions from 172 to 554 bp, and exhibited 98.0–99.3% nucleotide identity with them. In addition, the Guangxi naturally truncated strains had the highest homology of up to 95.9–96.6%, when compared with AJ1102, and exhibited 94.2–95.6% nucleotide identity when compared with the CV777, truncated CV777 strain, Zhejiang-08 and attenuated DR13. Interestingly, one unique substitution at C78T was found to be present in the Guangxi naturally truncated strains in the present study (
