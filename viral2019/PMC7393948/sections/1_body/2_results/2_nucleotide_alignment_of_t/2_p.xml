<p>A sketch map of the ORF3 comparisons of the strains, including CV777, AJ1102, truncated CV777, Zhejiang-08, attenuated DR13, and the Guangxi naturally truncated strains is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. The results show that the ORF3 gene of CV777 and AJ1102 were complete, and the truncated CV777, Zhejiang-08 strain and attenuated DR13 strain had 49 nucleotide deletions at 245â€“294 bp. Importantly, the Guangxi naturally truncated strains contained all the missing regions of these reference strains.
