<p>The results of amino acid sequence analysis indicated that all the strains were separated into three groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Among the Guangxi strains in this study, 33 strains were 675 bp in length and encoded a protein of 224 amino acids, and these belong to Group 1. The Guangxi naturally truncated strains were 293 bp in length and encoded a truncated protein of 89 amino acids, and these formed a new group referred to as Group 3. The ORF3 genes of the Guangxi naturally truncated strains exhibited 94.4–97.8% amino acids identity, whereas they had 69.3–72.7% identity to the truncated CV777, Zhejiang-08 and attenuated DR13 strains, and 65.2–71.9% identity to the CV777 and AJ1102. Within Group 2, there are 11 reference strains (including truncated CV777, Zhejiang-08, and attenuated DR13 strain) and translation in these strains was terminated early because of specific deletions, which were located at amino acids 86L−102L and 104G−121F, respectively.
