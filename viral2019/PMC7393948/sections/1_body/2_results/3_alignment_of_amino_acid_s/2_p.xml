<p>In terms of predicted amino acid sequence, strains in G1-1 and G1-3 subgroups all had an ORF3 of 224 amino acids, but their genotypes were different because of the amino acid mutations (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>); six specific amino acids (L24S, I70V, V80F, C107F, D168N, and Q182H) were present the G1-3 subgroups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Two strains (CV777 and LZC) were classified as G1-2 subgroups since there were only four substitutions, without V80F and Q182H. The Guangxi naturally truncated strains with 89aa in Group 3 were found to have a long length deletion, which were located at amino acids 61S−71F, 86L−119A, and 124H−129L, respectively. In addition, the L81 is located immediately before the truncation site in Group 2, while Group 2 consisted mostly of the cell-adapted strains.
