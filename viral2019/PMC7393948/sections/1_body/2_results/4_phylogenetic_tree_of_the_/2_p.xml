<p>Twenty-four strains were clustered into the G1-1 subgroup together with the major domestic strains such as YN15 and vaccine strains AJ1102 and GD-A, while nine strains were clustered to the G1-3 subgroup with major foreign strains such as PC22A and OH851. CV777 and LZC strains were clustered into the G1-2 subgroup. The deletions of the ORF3 gene such as the truncated CV777, Zhejiang-08 and other strains were clustered into Group 2. More importantly, the Guangxi naturally truncated strains were clustered into a new group referred to as Group 3.</p>
