<p>PED is a highly contagious intestinal infectious disease in pigs caused by PEDV, which has seriously affected the development of the pig breeding industry and caused significant economic losses. Since 2010, there has been a new round of PED epidemic in China (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The 49 nucleotide deletion at 245–294 bp is thought to be a marker of cellular adaptation, because most cell-adapted strains contain these deletions, but the evaluation of ORF3 slightly changed strains on cell culture need to be further investigated. It can also be used to distinguish the cell adaptive strains from the wild strains (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This suggests that ORF3 may be a multifunctional protein involved in cellular processes, but the exact biological function of PEDV ORF3 needs to be further defined (
