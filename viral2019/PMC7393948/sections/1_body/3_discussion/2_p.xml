<p>In this study, 38 PEDV strains from Guangxi were obtained from 33 field samples collected on pig farms. Among them, 24 strains were clustered into the G1-1 subgroup, and these were in the same branch as the reference strains, such as vaccine strain AJ1102, and 9 strains were in a branch of the G1-3 subgroup with reference strains such as foreign strains PC22A and OH851. Importantly, there were 5 strains with naturally truncated ORF3 genes and these formed a new gene group in a separate branch, and these were different when compared to the highly adapted cell strains such as the Chinese HLJBY and JS2008. We showed that the length of the deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF3 had only 89aa which was unique among the tested strains. Based on the genetic and evolutionary analysis of the ORF3 gene, we found that the endemic PEDV strains in Guangxi were complicated with three genotypes (G1-1 subgroup, G1-3 subgroup, and Group 3) co-existing simultaneously. The S protein is known to be an appropriate viral gene for determining the genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates, and the non-S INDEL and classical genogroups can be clearly differentiated in an S protein phylogenetic tree (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The variants in the S protein may change the virulence and tissue tropism of PEDV. However, the ORF3 and S gene are under different evolutionary pressures, and the correlation between the mutation rate of ORF3 gene and the pressure of selection of the host's immune response need to be further investigated.
