<p>There has been at least one type of ORF3 gene deletion reported. It is the type of deletion which mostly occurs during extensive passaging of the virus in cell cultures and this has been correlated with viral attenuation (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). With the deletion, the ORF3 gene of an attenuated-type virus has 49 nucleotide deletions, and this leads to a reading frame-shift and an early termination of translation (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It is mainly represented by the strains of truncated CV777, Zhejiang-08, JS2008, HLJBY, and attenuated DR13, which only has a 91aa truncated protein (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). It is noteworthy that the ORF3 protein of the Guangxi naturally truncated strains contain only residues of 89aa, since the 382-nucleotide deletion in the ORF3 results in a frameshift mutation and an early termination of translation. Like the L81 which is critical for PEDV rescue in reverse genetics and could possibly play an important role in the inhibitory activity of the ORF3 (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), the amino acid site of the E58 is located immediately before the truncation site in the five Guangxi natural truncated strains, and this specific region is due to the mutation of the amino acids, but the function of this is unknown. The effect of the Guangxi naturally truncated strains on ORF3 functions and viral pathogenicity remains to be investigated. It is worth considering whether the truncated part of the ORF3 gene should be used as a genetic marker for establishing methods to distinguish between different strains.
