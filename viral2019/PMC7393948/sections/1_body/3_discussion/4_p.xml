<p>PEDV strains with naturally occurring truncated ORF3 genes were found from different parts of Guangxi, originating from Qinzhou, Nanning, and Laibin, which suggested that this type of PEDV is present in only certain areas. Interestingly, the Guangxi naturally truncated strains all co-exist with strains of the G1-1 subgroup which contain complete ORF3 genes, which means that this type of PEDV may not infect pigs independently. The presence of different subtypes of PEDV in pigs may accelerate the mutation of the virus, and this can also increase the difficulty for the clinical prevention and control of PEDV. We have purified these two types of viruses by using the plaque assay and pathogenicity studies are currently in progress with these. The effect of the deletion of ORF3 associated with viral replication or virulence would be important for the understanding the gene function. Previously, JS2008 was considered to be a recombination of a vaccine strain and a PEDV variant strain (
