<p>This study identified 38 strains of PEDV ORF3 in the Guangxi province of China from 2017 to 2019. There were five naturally truncated strains which were clustered into a new group and these had longer length deletions in both nucleotides and amino acids sequences. This will hopefully facilitate the establishment of a diagnostic method that can differentiate the PEDV field stains. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of the naturally truncated ORF3 gene on the virulence of these PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three types PEDV strains, G1-1 subgroup, G1-3 subgroup and Group 3, co-circulated in the swine population in the Guangxi province of China. Continued surveillance will be useful for monitoring PEDV transmission. Differentiation of ORF3 genes in PEDV field strains can also help us to choose an appropriate PEDV vaccine candidate in the future and prevent outbreaks of PED more effectively.</p>
