 <caption> Detection and identification of two distinct bands of the ORF3 gene of PEDV in Guangxi. (A) Amplification of ORF3 gene in PEDV positive samples. M 1: DL 2000 marker; Lane 1: negative control; Lane 2: predicted product (740 bp); Lane 3: predicted product (740 bp) and large genomic deletion (~358 bp); Lane 4: CV777 strain; Lane 5: Zhejiang-08 strain; Lane 6: AJ1102 strain. (B) Identification of the plasmid, pMD-18T-ORF3, by enzyme digestion using PstI and BamHI. M 2: DL 5000 marker; Lane 1: The solid arrows indicate the predicted products (740 bp); Lane 2: The dashed arrows indicate products of PEDV variants with a large genomic deletion (~358 bp). </caption>
