 <caption>
  <p>Alignment of nucleotide sequences of ORF3 genes of the Guangxi naturally truncated strains and reference strains. Multiple nucleotide sequence alignments were analyzed by applying the Clustal V method with the MegAlign program. The asterisks indicate the genes with no differences found and those not shown in the figure, whereas the dashed lines represent the deleted nucleotides, and the shadows indicate the unique substitutions of the Guangxi naturally truncated strains.</p>
