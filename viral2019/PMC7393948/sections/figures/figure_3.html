 <caption> Comparison map of the ORF3 gene deletion in the Guangxi naturally truncated and reference strains. The ORF3 nucleotide sequences of the vaccine strains, CV777 and AJ1102, were 675bp, while the strains of truncated CV777, Zhejiang-08 and attenuated DR13 were 626 bp. The ORF3 of the Guangxi naturally truncated strains were all 293 bp, which contained the deletion area of the reference vaccine strain described above. </caption>
