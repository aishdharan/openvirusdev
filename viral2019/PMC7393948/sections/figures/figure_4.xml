 <caption>
  <p>Alignment of amino acid sequences of ORF3 proteins of the Guangxi PEDV and reference strains. The asterisks indicate the segments with no differences and not shown in the figure, whereas the dashed lines indicate deleted amino acids, and the shadows represent the unique substitutions of the chosen strains. Each PEDV strain is indicated in the following format: Country origin (three letter code: CHN, China; FRA, France; ITA, Italy; JPN, Japan; KOR, Korea; MEX, Mexico; SUI, Switzerland; USA, the United States)/strain name/year of sample collection (Genbank accession number). The Group 3 consisted of Guangxi naturally truncated strains which were coded in red. G1-1 subgroup, G1-2 subgroup, G1-3 subgroup and Group 2 were coded in blue, pink, yellow, and green, respectively. The triangle symbols represent the Guangxi field strains obtained in this study.</p>
