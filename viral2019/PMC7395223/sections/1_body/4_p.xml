<p id="p0025">The second hypothesis is that reduced mobility as a result of social isolation due to COVID-19 could have helped to reduce the true incidence of dengue in Brazil. Its known that the introduction of dengue into new populations is mediated by travel of infected individuals to areas that can support transmission, because mosquito vectors move only short distances during their lifetime [

For example, comparing urban mobility through the road infrastructure of highways in the State of Sao Paulo with the pattern of dengue dispersion, it is possible to notice an overlap of the dispersion clusters of dengue cases with large state highways (see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In the 20 km buffer around the main highways dengue occurs throughout the year in 87 of the 109 municipalities (about 80%). The decreased incidence of dengue after the 10th epidemiological week in 2020 may be related to decreased mobility as a result of measures implemented to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of social distance and reduced mobility adopted after the first COVID-19 cases may have altered the patterns of dispersion of the dengue virus in the State of Sao Paulo. It is necessary to carry out in-depth studies considering urban mobility data and evolution of the frequency of dengue cases during and after the period of COVID-19 epidemic. This unique situation of social isolation that we are currently experiencing provides a valuable opportunity to test hypotheses such as this, and to potentially improve dengue control strategies in the country.
