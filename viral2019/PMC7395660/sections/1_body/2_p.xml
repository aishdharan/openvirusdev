<p id="para0003">Data showed that both the median National BSIs (N-BSI) for insomnia appeared the highest during the timespan in the two years, with 4358 in 2020 and 4361 in 2019, and the difference was not statistically significant (

The daily BSI figures for panic and fear in Wuhan showed sharp rise after the announcement on lockdown of Wuhan, peaked on the third day, then kept fluctuating at high levels but exceeding the corresponding levels in 2019. The peak period for seeking psychological counseling started two weeks later among the public.
