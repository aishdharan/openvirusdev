 <p>We are interested in an article published in the journal recently, entitled “The potential impact of COVID-19-related disruption on tuberculosis burden”. The study used a mathematical model to estimate the relative impact of reductions in social contacts and health services on tuberculosis (TB) burden due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. There included data and projections on China, being one of 22 high TB burden countries for both TB and multidrug-resistant TB cases. COVID-19, which has spread rapidly and enveloped most of the world, is a unique global public health crisis for the century. By the end of January 2020, The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency and called for moves to stop the transmission of this virus. Accordingly, comprehensive and large-scale preventive and control measures were launched in February 2020.</p>
