Despite its inclusion in the influenza vaccine since 2010, H1N1pdm09 continues to circulate annually in the community and was the predominant influenza A virus strain during the 2019â€“2020 influenza epidemic. In contrast, the last human coronavirus epidemic, SARS (caused by SARS-CoV), abated because of aggressive containment procedures before a vaccine could be deployed; community transmission of SARS-CoV has not occurred since 2004. Based on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to date and anticipated vaccine development timelines, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 will not follow the abruptly terminating trajectory of SARS-CoV. Rather, it is likely that community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will continue as we enter the next influenza epidemic. Several factors, at least in part, will determine the overall severity of the upcoming respiratory virus season and can inform how we prepare:
