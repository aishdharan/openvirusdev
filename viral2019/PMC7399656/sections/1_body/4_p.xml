 <italic>)</italic> Co-infection. Co-infection with another respiratory pathogen, including influenza, occurred in more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2â€“positive patients who presented with a respiratory viral syndrome early in the COVID-19 pandemic (

The potential for co-infection carries diagnostic implications, as detection of an alternative etiology for a respiratory syndrome cannot be used to exclude COVID-19 in areas where SARS-CoV-2 testing remains limited. Clinicians may also need to modify therapeutic regimens depending on the specific copathogen (e.g., oseltamivir for influenza). These findings underscore the need for widespread availability of rapid diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.
