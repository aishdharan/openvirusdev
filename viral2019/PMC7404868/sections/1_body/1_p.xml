<p>At the present time, our ability to detect new pathogens before they lead to epidemic or pandemic disease is still woefully inadequate. To quickly and effectively respond to emerging and unexplained infectious disease outbreaks a well thought‐out early‐warning technology system needs to be designed and put in place. The primary goal of such a system should be to guide us to discover new pathogens
