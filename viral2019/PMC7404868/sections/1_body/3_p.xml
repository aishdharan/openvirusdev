<p>Once a potential pathogen is identified it is important next to determine through gene sequencing techniques (e.g. PCR) the precise species and its variants as quickly as possible. It would then be possible to launch a research program to produce effective preventive vaccines, devise treatment methods or manufacture drugs as may be relevant. If there is a way to make effective predictions of possible outbreaks of infectious diseases 
 <italic>ahead</italic> of their occurrence we may have enough early warning so that actions to respond to an epidemic can be prompt and timely.
