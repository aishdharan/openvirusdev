<p>It is becoming amply clear that we cannot solve the most fundamental questions relating to the origin of new viral infectious diseases within the comfort zone of Earth‐bound medical science alone. First and foremost we need to abandon our tendency towards academic isolation and examine relevant facts from widely disparate fields ‐ physics, meteorology and space science – if we are to achieve our desired objectives. It is only with such an initiative that we can come anywhere near the prevention and control of infectious diseases in the long term.</p>
