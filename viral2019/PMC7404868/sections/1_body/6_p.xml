<p>At the present time we tend to believe that the emergence of new viral infectious diseases is mainly related to human activities or ecological factors. These include contact with wild animals, animal trade, new farmland reclamation, urbanization and rapid population growth, international tourism, population flow, climate change and similar factors. However, a stark fact that has either gone unnoticed or ignored is that most new viral infectious diseases seem to emerge in specific years ‐ immediately implying an astronomical context. The inevitable implication is that there must be some “unusual” cosmic factors in these specific years – in the Earth's configuration in relation to the wider Universe ‐ which play a decisive role. Therefore, only by discovering these “unusual” factors can we expect to find the root cause of occurrence of new viral infectious diseases, and thus be able to make scientific predictions of future new pandemics.</p>
