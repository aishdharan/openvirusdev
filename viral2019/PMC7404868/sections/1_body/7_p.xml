<p>If particular years can be identified as a causative link an astronomical connection immediately suggests itself. The first lesson from astronomy is of course that the Earth is an insignificant planet in the universe – one of perhaps a hundred billion similar planets in our galaxy alone. As humans, we live on planet Earth but we also live in a far wider context – within a universe which is full of similar planets. Recent studies have shown the likelihood of life on Earth being part of a cosmic‐wide biosphere.

We also know that the Earth is physically connected to the Universe – cosmic rays from the sun and from the galaxy reaches the Earth and also 10–100 of tonnes of meteoric dust (some of it organic) enters the Earth every single day. It is a pity that most modern researchers in the biological sciences do not realize these facts. It would appear very likely that all life on the Earth, including humans, will be genetically affected by the changes of our immediate space environment and various accompanying cosmic phenomena at any time. These include a variable flux of ionizing radiation – X rays, gamma rays, cosmic rays – that have a mutagenic effect on endemic terrestrial viruses, and even perhaps the addition of viruses from space, a wider cosmic environment, included in the daily tonnage of debris entering our planet from space.
