<p>It is interesting in this context to recall that the word influenza comes from the Italian word 
 <italic>influencia</italic>, meaning influence – and implying in this case influence of the stars. In the middle ages people saw connections between phenomena in the skies and events on Earth, and on this basis came to believe that many disasters were indeed related to the stars and celestial phenomena. To ancient people it seemed rational to believe that stars and the Universe could release “things” affecting the Earth! In certain respects, they appear to have been right.
