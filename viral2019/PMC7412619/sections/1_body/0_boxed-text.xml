    <p>Female sex workers (FSWs) are a key population that should be targeted for HIV prevention and treatment strategies. Improving consistent condom use, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for this population can likely lead to important reductions in HIV prevalence and incidence.</p>

    <p>Sub-Saharan African countries with limited resources such as Rwanda face a large HIV epidemic, so understanding how these strategies will affect the HIV epidemic is important.</p>

    <p>This analysis confirms the need for a continued focus on FSWs in this country. Continuing to improve the quality and the access of existing preventive and treatment interventions with a new investment in PrEP will likely translate to the largest public health impact on the HIV epidemic.</p>
