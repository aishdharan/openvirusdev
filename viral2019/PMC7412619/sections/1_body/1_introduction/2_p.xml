<p>Rwanda has specified efforts to test and treat HIV+ FSWs with antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 counts, in an effort to reduce HIV transmission.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Targeted efforts include an intensive prevention package for FSWs. Mobile services and outreach activities have been implemented to reach FSW populations regardless of their location or work environment.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> At the facility level, services such as HIV counselling and testing, family planning and sexual reproductive health services, STI screening and treatment, and condom provision are offered to FSWs.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Outreach involves hotel and bar-based services, street services and opportunities to engage FSWs involved in incidental transactions.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Healthcare providers receive training to minimise stigma faced by FSWs and prevent avoidance for accessing healthcare services.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition, implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) targeted at FSWs is currently being considered for the next revision of HIV and AIDS National Strategic Plan for the year 2019. This targeted intervention of PrEP along with the other efforts to increase utilisation of other HIV services and ART coverage for FSWs will likely result in reduced likelihood of HIV transmission.
