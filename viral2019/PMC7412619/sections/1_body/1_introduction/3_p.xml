<p>It is therefore vital to understand how the incidence and prevalence of HIV will be affected by Rwanda’s specific initiatives for FSWs. Given constrained resources for HIV treatment and prevention services, it is important to estimate the prevalence and incidence rates of HIV over time for strategic planning. Using nationally representative and FSW specific data in Rwanda,
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8–11</xref> we developed a dynamic Markov model to estimate the prevalence and incidence rates of HIV among FSWs and sex clients over the next 10 years. In this study, we estimated the effects of ART, PrEP and condom-use-based prevention strategies on the HIV epidemic in Rwanda. In particular, we examine the evolution of incidence and prevalence in the FSW population, male sex clients and in the overall population.
