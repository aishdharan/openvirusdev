<p>We developed a nationwide dynamic Markov model
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> for transmission of HIV from 2017 to 2027 to estimate the incidence and prevalence of HIV among FSWs, sex clients and the general population in Rwanda. Our model includes national level demographic data, sexual and sero-behavioural information of these three populations, HIV-associated morbidity, all-cause mortality and HIV-related mortality. We considered the HIV transmission, testing patterns, adherence to ART and their likelihood for viral suppression for FSWs, their male sex clients and the general population. Finally, as introduction of PrEP to FSWs is expected in Rwanda by year 2019, the model assumes and captures an expected 25% PrEP uptake in the FSW population by the end of 2019 with a gradual increase to 65% PrEP use in the year 2027.
