<p>For each population, our Markov model considered the following six states: (1) HIV negative; (2) undiagnosed HIV+; (3) HIV+ pre ART; (4) HIV+ on ART with viral suppression; (5) HIV+ on ART without viral suppression; and 6) death. Here, state (5) represents a setting where viral suppression is not achieved under their ART regimen, or the individuals have discontinued ART for the duration of the cycle. Graphical representation of the Markov chain is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. In addition, we considered transitions from one population to another, while remaining in the same state. That is, in each cycle, some transitions are accounted for from belonging to the general population and engaging in sex work or buying sex, and some FSWs and clients disengaging from having paid sex and moving back to the general population risk scheme for acquiring HIV. A time horizon of 10 years was considered starting in 2017 up to 2027. Cycle duration was set to 3 months with transition probabilities derived accordingly. Detailed description of our model is provided in the
