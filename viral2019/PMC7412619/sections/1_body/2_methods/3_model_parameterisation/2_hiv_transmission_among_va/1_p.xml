<p>We assumed transmission of HIV occurs between FSWs and their sex clients, as well as between the sex clients and the general population (eg, the male sex clients transmit the virus to their female sexual partners in the general population). In our analysis, we did not consider the case where FSWs could directly transmit HIV to the general population. We assumed an average number of 52 sex clients per year for each FSW, as well as an average number of 2.5 exposures (sex acts) per client, per year (ie, the average number of times a client seeks out an FSW annually). HIV transmission probabilities were computed using equations (1)â€“(4) provided in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary material</xref> (see the HIV transmission probabilities section of the supplementary material). In those equations, we incorporate the size of each population, HIV prevalence among the population of male sex clients, the average number of sexual exposures for each group, condom use or use of PrEP, the risk of HIV transmission per sexual intercourse (unprotected and protected) and the type of intercourse (anal vs vaginal). The values assumed for these parameters are presented and justified in
