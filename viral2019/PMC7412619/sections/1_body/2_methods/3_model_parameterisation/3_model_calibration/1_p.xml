<p>We calibrated our model based on the rate of HIV prevalence among FSWs and the general population using data that were collected in 2010
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and 2015.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The estimated HIV prevalence among FSWs were 50% in 2010 and 45.5% in 2017 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary figure 1</xref>). We compared the estimated HIV incidence from our calibrated model with the HIV incidence rates that were reported by the UNAIDSâ€™s spectrum.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 17</xref> The HIV prevalence among the sex clients was estimated to be 14.5% in 2015. The estimated national HIV prevalence has remained constant at approximately 3% over the past decade.
