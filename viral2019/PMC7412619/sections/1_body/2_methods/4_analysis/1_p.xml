<p>Using the base values from the calibrated model, we recorded the evolution of annual HIV prevalence and incidence from 2017 to 2027 in our Markov model. For each analysis, 1000 simulations with multinomial allocations of people to different Markov states each year were performed. Base case scenario input parameters are all presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> as well as in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary tables 1 and 2</xref> as described in the Methods section. We considered worst and best-case scenario analysis for key parameters related to testing behaviour and ART coverage, condom use and PrEP uptake, as well as growth or decline in the FSW population. The considered parameters and the assumed worst-case and best-case estimates are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary tables 4 and 5</xref>.
