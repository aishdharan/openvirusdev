<p>The overall number of people living with HIV (ie, HIV prevalence) and the incidence rate of HIV (per 1000 person-years) from 2017 to 2027 in Rwanda are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>. With PrEP, the number of people living with HIV increased from 344 971 in 2017 to 395 453 by year 2027 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary table 6</xref>), corresponding to a 1.37% annual growth (note, the general population growth rate is 2.41%). With the current HIV testing and ART coverage, the annual incidence of FSWs living with HIV remained stable over the 10-year period. With the current HIV testing and ART coverage, the annual overall population incidence rate decreased from 2017 (1.36 per 1000 person-years) to 2027 (1.20 per 1000 person-years) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary table 7</xref>). With the introduction of PrEP in 2019, the annual incidence decreased further with a notable additional decrease in 2020, and a continuing decrement to 1.06 per 1000 person-years in 2027 (
