 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">Online supplementary table 4</xref> presents the worst-case and best-case scenarios for the 2027 HIV prevalence estimates for the selected scenario analysis parameters. The tornado diagrams illustrating each of the three populationsâ€™ sensitivities to changes in the explored parameters (ie, magnitude of change in results under the worst-case and best-case scenarios) are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary figure 5</xref>. For the parameter of testing and treatment, we observed the following trends. Increased testing for FSWs was associated with a small reduction in the HIV prevalence among sex clients. Increased testing of the general population combined with increased national coverage of ART were associated with a reduction in the HIV prevalence among FSWs and their male sex clients. Improved adherence to ART had a moderate impact on the HIV prevalence in FSWs, their male sex clients and the general population, but a worsening in ART adherence was associated with a larger negative effect with the increased HIV prevalence. Changes in HIV testing or ART-related parameters, however, never exceeded 1.1%. For use of condoms, the best-case scenario for increased use among FSWs reduces the prevalence by 7.86% (37.37% vs 29.51%) among the FSW population and by 5.97% (17.87% vs 11.90%) among their male sex clients. In the worst-case scenario with decreased condom use among FSWs, however, the models estimated a 4.59% and 3.4% increase in the HIV prevalence in FSWs and their male sex clients, respectively. An increase in condom use among FSWs reduced the HIV prevalence in the overall population by 0.11%. The best-case scenario of increased condom use in the general population yields a 0.17% absolute decrease in the HIV prevalence in the overall population (ie, a 6.46% relative reduction) but did not affect the prevalence among FSWs or their male sex clients.
