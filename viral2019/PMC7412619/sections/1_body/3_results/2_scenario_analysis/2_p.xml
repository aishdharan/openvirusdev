<p>Similarly, a worst-case reduction in condom use in the general population was associated with an increase in the HIV prevalence. The best-case scenarios for PrEP use among FSWs resulted in a 1.28% reduction in the HIV prevalence among FSWs, whereas in the worst-case scenario, a 1.27% increase in the HIV prevalence can be expected. Best-case scenarios for condom use and PrEP use yielded the largest reduction in the HIV prevalence overall, and no further reduction were observed from added HIV testing, ART coverage and adherence under this scenario. However, the worst-case scenarios for condom use and PrEP were still worsened further, if combined with worst case scenarios for HIV testing, ART coverage and adherence.</p>
