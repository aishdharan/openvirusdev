<p>The scenario analyses and the tornado diagrams of the 2027 HIV incidence estimates (per 1000 person-years) are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary table 5 and figure 6</xref>, respectively. Different scenario analyses showed incidence estimates that aligned similar to the prevalence estimates. Changes in testing and treatment for ART showed small changes in the HIV incidence rates for FSWs, their male sex clients and the general population; collectively, when testing for FSWs and general population was combined with increased ART coverage and adherence, the estimated HIV incidence for sex clients showed large reduction (
 <italic>Scenario 1E</italic>: 12.45 to 11.29 cases per 1000 person-years). In the best-case scenario with increased condom use among FSWs, the models estimated a decrease in the HIV incidence by 12.25 cases per 1000 person-years (down to 3.59 per 1000 person-years) for FSWs and 0.16 cases per 1000 person-years (down to 0.92 per 1000 person-years) for the overall population, but increased condom use in FSWs did not affect the HIV incidence rates for the general population. The best-case scenarios for PrEP use among FSWs resulted in a 27.46% relative reduction in incidence among FSWs. Best-case scenarios for condom use combined with PrEP use yielded the largest reduction in the incidence among the FSWs, sex clients and the overall population, and no important reductions were observed from the best-case scenarios of improved HIV testing, ART coverage and ART adherence.
