<p>Since 2016 after implementing the test-and-treat strategy, Rwanda has observed drastic improvements in several HIV-related outcomes.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The national ART coverage and testing has increased considerably in the last decade. The overall number of people who are now aware of their HIV status and treated with ART has also improved. In combination, these measures have led to a stabilisation of the overall HIV prevalence at 3% in Rwanda.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The continued epidemic of HIV in Rwanda is largely driven by the concentrated HIV epidemic among FSWs and their sex clients. Our findings highlight a number of key components for containing and reducing the HIV epidemic in Rwanda. A continued promotion of ART-based prevention strategies, particularly among high-risk population such as FSWs, is essential in keeping the HIV epidemic stabilised in this country. While having a minor effect in the general population, the expected introduction of PrEP will likely have a substantial impact on both the incidence and prevalence of FSWs and sex clients, with the HIV incidence among FSWs greatly being reduced by PrEP.
