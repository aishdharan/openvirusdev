<p>There have been other FSW economic models that have previously been published (

 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–23</xref>To our knowledge, our Markov model is the first to examine effects of the ART, condoms and PrEP, specifically, in the geographical setting of Rwanda. The focus of other studies has been on regions such as Côte d'Ivoire, India, Benin and South Africa, with a deterministic modelling approach for some. Similar to our study, the majority of these models (n=4/6) considered three populations in FSWs, sex clients and the general population. The economic model by Maheu-Giroux

 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> considered another high-risk group in men who have sex with other men. The model by Mukandavire 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> considered the role of pimps in the HIV epidemic, but this model was not specific to any countries. Mukandavire 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> was also the only other economic model that considered the role of PrEP and condoms on the HIV prevalence and incidence; however, this study did not consider the role of ART simultaneously with these other two preventive intervention strategies.
