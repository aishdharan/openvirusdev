<p>Our model and analyses have several strengths and limitations. Our model capitalised on access to rich up-to-date nationwide Rwandan-specific data sources and interaction with the Ministry of Health officials who were available to provide the local context. As a result, most of the transition probabilities are directly informed by data with high internal validity.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The used data, however, are all cross-sectional and not representative of the local subpopulations of FSWs that may have different geographical challenges and constraints. In addition, it is possible that the estimated value may be under-reported, particularly for sexual risk behaviour questions (eg, number of sexual partners) that were self-reported. There was limited information on behaviours of sex clients, and as a result, it was necessary to indirectly model these via the links to FSWs and the general population. To estimate the HIV transmission probabilities for our Markov model, we had to rely on self-reported data on sexual behaviours, which are likely subject to some bias. Our model did not include other key risk populations (eg, men who have sex with men, male sex workers and sero-discordant couples) in Rwanda.
