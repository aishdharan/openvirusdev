<p>As Rwanda prepares to plan for its fourth edition of its National Strategy Plan for HIV/AIDS, it recognises the necessity for a continued focus on FSWs. Efforts to increase the testing of HIV in FSWs, ensuring lifelong ART in HIV positive FSWs with provision at diagnosis, and education of this group, sex clients and other members of the general population through public health education and health promotion campaigns will need to be continued, along with efforts to improve consistent condom use. Our model shows that improving the condom use will have a substantial effect on HIV prevalence in the FSW and general population. Promoting condom use among FSWs will dramatically reduce prevalence among sex clients over the next 10 years. Moreover, the planned introduction of PrEP to FSWs in 2019 will have a substantial effect on the FSW population as the incidence of HIV drops drastically after its (modelled) introduction and continues to decline steeply. The individual prophylactic efficacy of increased testing and ART coverage, condom use and PrEP uptake among HIV negative FSWs hold much promise, and in the long run, may be the long-term strategy to control the HIV epidemic in Rwanda.</p>
