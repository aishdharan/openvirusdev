<p>Despite the progress made in containing the HIV epidemic in Rwanda, the concentration of the HIV epidemic remains high in marginalised groups such as FSWs. There have been limited investigations on FSWs. Future research that needs to be prioritised include FSWs’ ability to negotiate condom use with their clients and ways to increase diagnostic testing of HIV and other STIs in FSWs. Existing barriers that affect FSWs’ acceptability and adherence to ART and PrEP should be explored and addressed to remove barriers that are institutionalised. This study has demonstrated the need for continued efforts to improve and expand the quality of existing HIV services (eg, more testing and ART), as well the potential gain of adopting a targeted intervention strategy such as PrEP in FSWs and other key drivers of the HIV epidemic not only in Rwanda but also in other sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
