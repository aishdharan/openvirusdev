     <p id="p0035">Specific molecular assays for the diagnosis of highly pathogenic coronaviruses were developed and are usually only available at public health laboratories and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but public health as well as clinical laboratories should harbor this diagnostic capacity in order to nimbly respond to an outbreak.</p>
