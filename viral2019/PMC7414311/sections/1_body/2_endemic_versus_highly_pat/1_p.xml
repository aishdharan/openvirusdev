<p id="p0055">Four human coronaviruses have been established as endemic: HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. These endemic strains have been identified as significant causes of acute respiratory infection and the common cold, causing 15% to 30% of respiratory tract infections each year.

The outbreak of SARS in China in 2002 to 2003 highlighted the potential of these and/or related viruses to cause outbreaks of severe disease, because more than 8000 cases were diagnosed with close to a 10% case fatality rate.

 </xref> In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first isolated from the city of Wuhan, China, and rapidly millions of cases were reported from almost every country in the world. This most novel coronavirus was characterized by extensive spread and apparently higher infectivity or more efficient human-to-human transmission. At the time of this submission (July 1, 2020), 511,860 deaths were associated with COVID-19 of a total of 10,501,482 confirmed global cases (
