<p id="p0060">Most of the animal and human coronaviruses are thought to originate from bats. Next-genome sequencing (NGS) of the bat virome revealed that 35% are coronaviruses, more than 200 of which were novel species.

 </xref> Because human coronaviruses all have zoonotic origin, it is essential to understand the determinants of spillover from bats or other natural reservoirs to humans. Surveillance studies with thorough genomic characterization are vital to predict the next novel highly pathogenic coronavirus epidemic.
