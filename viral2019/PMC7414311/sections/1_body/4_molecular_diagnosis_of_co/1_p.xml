<p id="p0070">Nucleic acid detection methods are more sensitive than traditional methods of diagnosis that include cell culture, and offer higher specificity. In general, there are 3 goals of molecular coronavirus diagnosis in the clinical microbiology and public health laboratories: routine diagnostics of endemic strains, the diagnosis of highly pathogenic strains in endemic areas and during outbreaks, and the detection and characterization of novel unidentified viruses. For coronavirus molecular identification, assays that could generally detect all known human coronaviruses as well as assays that could distinguish the different species were developed. In addition, NGS has advanced the understanding of new coronaviruses and showed a great potential in their identification directly from clinical specimens, although these assays have not yet entered routine practice in the clinical laboratory.</p>
