<p id="p0075">With the wide prevalence of endemic coronaviruses as significant causes of upper respiratory tract infection, implementing methods for routine diagnosis has become a common practice. At present, diagnosing coronaviruses in clinical microbiology laboratories is a part of most of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared respiratory panel assays (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). These panels usually are supplemented with oligonucleotides specific for the 4 endemic HCoVs. These assays usually target the N gene; however, several laboratory-developed assays have used primers that target the polymerase, M or S genes, or the 5′ untranslated region. Most of these assays are multiplex or nested real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.

 </xref> Because of their species specificity, these assays usually cannot identify novel coronaviruses. The FilmArray respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT) and the ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA) are currently two of the most commonly used extended respiratory panels. In addition to detecting the 4 endemic coronaviruses, the FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2

In addition, the BioFire Respiratory 2.1 (RP2.1) Panel with SARS-CoV-2 received FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. The QIAGEN QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-Cov-2 Panel is an extended respiratory panel that also received an EUA for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.
