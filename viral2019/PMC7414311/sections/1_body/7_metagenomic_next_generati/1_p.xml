<p id="p0095">NGS is a high-throughput method that allows massive parallel sequencing of billions of DNA fragments simultaneously. mNGS is an unbiased, untargeted method for sequencing all genomes in a particular specimen.

 </xref> mNGS for viral identification in outbreak situations is very valuable in the absence of prior knowledge of the pathogen and facilitates quick phylogenetic characterization. mNGS has assisted in the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens in patients with pneumonia and has provided rapid insight into the genome and its phylogenetic relationship to other coronaviruses. As a response to this outbreak, a metagenomics deep-sequencing method using the MGI DNBSEQ-T7 sequencer (Cambridge, MA) for diagnosing coronaviruses in general was developed. This platform and the metagenomics coronavirus sequencing kit (BGI Group) have received an emergency use approval in China.
