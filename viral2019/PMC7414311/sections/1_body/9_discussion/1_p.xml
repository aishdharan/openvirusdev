<p id="p0130">Rapidly emerging viral outbreaks pose a great challenge to clinical laboratories for quickly developing assays with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and infection control. Molecular methods have rapidly replaced traditional methods and assisted the laboratories in real-time epidemiologic surveillance in outbreak situations. The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 highlighted a great advance in the molecular diagnosis of evolving viral pathogens. Metagenomics, facilitated by innovative sequencing methodologies, is driving faster pathogen characterization and epidemiologic investigations. Because of the challenges in developing a PCR assay that has the potential for detecting all species of evolving RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, an approach that aims at implementing mNGS directly from clinical specimens along with complementary molecular diagnostic methods is most appropriate for clinically and epidemiologically managing a novel coronavirus outbreak. It is not currently possible to rapidly identify a novel coronavirus, but methodologies are being quickly developed that will change the current workflow in response to an emergent viral strain.</p>
