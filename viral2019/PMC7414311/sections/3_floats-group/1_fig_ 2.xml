  <p>Genome organization of the 7 human coronaviruses. The genomes range in size from 26 to about 32 kb. The order of the genome is typically 5′-ORF1a-ORF1b-S-E-M-N-3’. ORF1a and ORF1b overlap and occupy the 5′ two-thirds of the genome. Both encode for the components required for replication and transcription. The 3′ one-third of the genome encodes for structural (S-E-M-N) and accessory proteins (
