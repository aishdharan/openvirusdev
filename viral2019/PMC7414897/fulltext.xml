Since the discovery of the low-pathogenic genotype 1b (G1b) in 2014, it has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in South Korea. In this study, we identified novel G1b variants arising from the natural recombination of a major pandemic-like G2b virus and a minor G1b virus currently circulating in the domestic field. The whole-genome sequences of two 2018&#x02013;19 G1b recombinants, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were determined. A genomic comparison showed that these two viruses share the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with the 2017 G1b strain but share less similarity with the 2014 G1b emergent strain KNU-1406. However, the putative recombination breakpoints spanning the first 1,170 nucleotides of the spike (S) gene were almost identical among the emergent and contemporary G1b strains. Recombination detection indicated that the inter-subgroup G1b recombinant first emerged in 2017 by introducing the N-terminal domain of S from KNU-1406 into the backbone of KNU-1703, possibly leading to antigenic shift. It then evolved into KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 through genetic drift, moving toward a more G2b-like genotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 2018&#x02013;2019 G1b recombinants belong to a cluster containing other G1b strains but form a new branch. This study provides an important advance warning in regard to the emergence and prevalence of new genotypes or variants that can result from genetic recombination between two different PEDV genotypes circulating in endemic areas and continuous non-lethal mutations essential for viral fitness in the host environment.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s00705-020-04767-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013129</institution-id><institution>Ministry of SMEs and Startups</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P0010011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Changhee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious and deadly swine coronavirus that belongs to the genus <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> in the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> of the order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. PEDV causes a serious enteric disease in pigs that results in severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with very high mortality rates in newborn piglets. Since the 2013&#x02013;2014 fatal pandemic, the virus has gained global attention and a reputation as an economic menace to the world pork industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. PEDV can be divided into two genotypes comprising two subgenotypes: low-pathogenic (LP) genotype 1 (historic G1a and recombinant G1b) and highly pathogenic (HP) genotype 2 (local epidemic G2a and global epidemic or pandemic G2b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

All samples were positive for PEDV (Supplementary Fig. S1A) with Ct values ranging from 17.1 to 22.5, and no other viral pathogens that cause diarrhea were detected in these cases. Subsequently, the complete S gene sequences of the isolates were determined. Nucleotide (nt) sequencing analysis revealed that two strains, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were genetically cognate, having 99.6% amino acid (aa) sequence identity. Since these isolates showed 98.4&#x02013;98.5% and 95.3&#x02013;95.4% aa sequence identity to the Korean prototype G1b KNU-1406 and G2b KNU-141112 strains, respectively, they were classified as the LP-G1b subtype (Supplementary Table S1).</p><p id="Par8">The LP-PEDV G1b strains appear to have originated from a recombination event between a virus G1a as the minor parent and a virus G2b as the major parent (e.g. &#x0003e; 99% sequence identity to G2b for the whole genome but &#x02264; 89% and 95% sequence identity to G2b and G1a, respectively, from nt 1 to 1,170 of S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

All G1b isolates identified in this study possessed the aforementioned characteristics (Supplementary Fig. S2).

The genetic similarity between the full S gene sequences of the query G1a (consensus) strain and the G1b or G2b (consensus) isolates was plotted using SimPlot analysis. As expected, the sequence similarity of the first 1,170 nt of S was distinctly different between the G2b and KNU-1406 strains (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Eight methods in the RDP4 software package were used to detect recombination events and breakpoints, and the results are summarized in Supplementary Table S4. Two putative recombination sites were detected between nt 20,661 and nt 22,597 in the genome of KNU-1702, corresponding to nt 28&#x02013;1,964 of the S gene. All eight detection methods revealed that the major and minor parental viruses of the recombination event are the PEDV pandemic-like HP-G2b strain KNU-1703 (MH052682) and the LP-G1b strain KNU-1406, respectively (average <italic>P</italic>-value, 1.76 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;25</sup>). Similarly, the recombination events in KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 were independently confirmed by all eight modules with a high degree of confidence (average <italic>P</italic>-values, 7.95 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup> and 3.07 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;22</sup>, respectively), consistently indicating that KNU-1703 and KNU-1406 represent the backbone and inserted sequence, respectively. However, the genomes of the 2018&#x02013;19 G1b variants all contained putative recombination points at nt 20,661 and nt 21,318 nt, corresponding to nt 28 and nt 684 in the S gene. Similarity plots showed high overall sequence similarity between the G1b recombinant and the parental G2b KNU-1703 strains, but the sequence similarity significantly decreased in the putative recombinant positions between nt 28 and nt 1,964, or nt 28 and nt 684 of the S gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Analogous to the S gene-based SimPlot data (Supplementary Fig. S3), all methods detected the truncated sequence endpoint for the 2018&#x02013;19 G1b strains, which was predicted at nt 684 in the S gene. Interestingly, the 2018&#x02013;19 recombinants had four unique substitutions (S232I, D242E, S243P, and L266V) within the truncated segment spanning nt 684&#x02013;1,964 of the S gene when compared to that of other G1b strains, including KNU-1702. However, the changed amino acids were identical to those found in the G2b field isolates (Supplementary Fig. S2), possibly leading to the alteration of the sequence endpoint from nt 22,597 to nt 21,318 in the genome (or nt 1,964 to 684 in the S gene). Considering that the most recently identified G1b virus (KNU-1702) and the major parental virus (KNU-1703) were isolated in the same year, the inter-subgroup recombination event appears to have occurred in 2017. This event created the novel G1b variant, which in turn underwent point mutations in the S1 region that shifted it toward the more-G2b-like strain.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Recombination analyses of 2018&#x02013;19 Korean PEDV G1b strains.

Genetic recombination of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, is a major driving force of rapid viral evolution that leads to the emergence of new strains or viruses. Thus, new traits or phenotypes and novel coding sequences can frequently be acquired by recombination between members of the same or different viral species or families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our data indicate that the NTD of the S gene is a common target for natural recombination between two different genotypes of PEDV. Since this domain includes one putative neutralizing epitope (NTD/S0) located between aa positions 19 and 220 [19], frequent recombination events may afford some advantages (e.g., antigenic shift) that allow the virus to evade host immune defenses such as neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S4). Also, we found ongoing genetic drift in both the major and minor parental portions of the novel G1b recombinants. In particular, the NTD of the S gene, representing the minor parental virus, contained four aa changes outside of the NTD/S0 epitope, which could genetically shift the G1b recombinant to the G2b-like virus and possibly enhance pathogenesis. Indeed, the two PEDV-na&#x000ef;ve swine farms in this study experienced mild neonatal mortality rates, which differed somewhat from previous reports describing the low pathogenicity of G1b isolates, which commonly showed minimal to no clinical signs or mortality associated with PED in piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To corroborate this field observation, we are currently isolating new PEDV recombinants that can grow in cell culture, which will allow us to conduct a challenge study. Further, reverse genetics studies will likely provide fundamental clues regarding the possible relationship of recombination and additional mutations to PEDV pathogenesis.</p><p id="Par13">Although the Korean emergent G1b KNU-1406 strain was first detected in Gyeongbuk Province and subsequently spread across the country, the contemporary 2017&#x02013;19 G1b recombinants and the major parental 2017 G2b viruses were identified in Chungcheong Province and the adjacent Gyeonggi Province (Supplementary Fig. S5). It is noteworthy that all of the pig farms where those 2017&#x02013;19 G1b or G2b viruses were detected belong to the same farmers&#x02019; cooperative. Therefore, it is likely that the cooperative shared several farm-to-farm transmission sources, including traffic and humans, and that these transmission sources acted as an intermediate environment that provided favorable conditions for two circulating viruses (i.e. KNU-1406 and KNU-1703) to simultaneously or sequentially contaminate a single farm during the 2017 outbreaks. This generated a new G1b recombinant (i.e., KNU-1702), which continued to undergo non-lethal mutations and was probably dispersed throughout its associated farms (KNU-1808 and KNU-1909), possibly recovering G2b-like virulence. These types of circumstances may favor the emergence of new genotypes or variants in the domestic herd with greater pathogenicity than the prototype G1b and against which the current G2b vaccine may provide incomplete protection. Continuous surveillance for novel variants is paramount for RNA viruses, including PEDV, that have rapid evolutionary rates. Therefore, the present study underlines the importance of performing periodic monitoring and surveillance investigations, which aid in the development of vaccines against variant or new-genotype viruses that may cause future epidemics or pandemics.
