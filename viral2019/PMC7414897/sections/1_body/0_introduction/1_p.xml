<p id="Par2">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious and deadly swine coronavirus that belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> of the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. PEDV causes a serious enteric disease in pigs that results in severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with very high mortality rates in newborn piglets. Since the 2013–2014 fatal pandemic, the virus has gained global attention and a reputation as an economic menace to the world pork industry [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although the HP-G2b genotype has been the dominant epidemic strain in South Korea since the 2013–2014 national disaster, it is not uncommon for the LP-G1b strains of PEDV to cause small-scale local, economically insignificant outbreaks across the mainland [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This study provides, for the first time, direct evidence of emerging novel recombinant LP-PEDV G1b strains that share the backbone sequence of pandemic G2b and an N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike (S) gene from G1b circulating in South Korea.
