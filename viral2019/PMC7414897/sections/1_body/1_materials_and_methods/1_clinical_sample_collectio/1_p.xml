<p id="Par3">In December 2018 and January 2019, enteric and diarrheal diseases accompanied by low mortality rates (10–20%) in newborn piglets (&lt; 7 days of age) occurred consecutively in two different farrow-to-finish commercial swine farms with no previous herd history of PED vaccination or PED outbreaks located in Chungcheong Province (Supplementary Fig. S1). Diarrheic piglets (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) from those farms were submitted for laboratory analysis. Intestinal homogenates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) were prepared as 10% (wt/vol) suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a MagNA Lyser Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with three rounds of 15 s at a force of 8,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>. Fecal samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) were also diluted with PBS to prepare 10% (wt/vol) suspensions. The suspensions were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4,500 × 
 <italic>g</italic> (Hanil Centrifuge FLETA5, Incheon, South Korea). The clarified supernatants were initially subjected to RT-PCR analysis using a LiliF PED RT-PCR Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, South Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and to quantitative real-time RT-PCR as described previously [
