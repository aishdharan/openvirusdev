<p id="Par4">The S glycoprotein gene sequences of the virus isolates from intestinal or fecal suspensions with the highest viral load (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) representing each farm were determined by traditional Sanger methods. Two overlapping cDNA fragments spanning the entire S gene of each isolate were amplified by RT-PCR as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The individual cDNA amplicons were gel-purified, cloned using the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced in both directions using two commercial vector-specific T7 and SP6 primers and gene-specific primers. The complete genomes of representative PEDV field strains were also sequenced. Ten overlapping cDNA fragments spanning the entire genome of each virus strain were amplified by RT-PCR as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and each PCR product was sequenced as described above. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the genomes of the individual isolates were determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The complete genomic sequences of KOR/KNU-1808/2018/G1b and KOR/KNU-1909/2019/G1b in this study were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers MN816181 and MN844888, respectively. For sequencing analysis, we selected at least five colonies obtained from pGEM cloning to rule out the possibility of a mixed G1b-G2b PEDV infection in a single sample as well as to exclude any contamination during sample preparation.
