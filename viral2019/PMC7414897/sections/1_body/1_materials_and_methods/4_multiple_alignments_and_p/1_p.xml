<p id="Par6">The sequences of 72 fully sequenced S genes and 63 complete genomes of global PEDV isolates were used independently in sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using the ClustalX 2.0 program [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the percentage of nucleotide sequence divergence was assessed using the same software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the aligned nucleotide or amino acid sequences using the neighbor-joining method and were subjected to bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates to determine the percentage reliability values for each internal node of the tree [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. All phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGA X software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
