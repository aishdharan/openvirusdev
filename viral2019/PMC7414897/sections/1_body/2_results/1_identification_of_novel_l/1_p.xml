<p id="Par7">Small-intestine specimens and feces collected from diarrheic piglets were initially subjected to virus-specific RT-PCR assays. All samples were positive for PEDV (Supplementary Fig. S1A) with Ct values ranging from 17.1 to 22.5, and no other viral pathogens that cause diarrhea were detected in these cases. Subsequently, the complete S gene sequences of the isolates were determined. Nucleotide (nt) sequencing analysis revealed that two strains, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were genetically cognate, having 99.6% amino acid (aa) sequence identity. Since these isolates showed 98.4–98.5% and 95.3–95.4% aa sequence identity to the Korean prototype G1b KNU-1406 and G2b KNU-141112 strains, respectively, they were classified as the LP-G1b subtype (Supplementary Table S1).</p>
