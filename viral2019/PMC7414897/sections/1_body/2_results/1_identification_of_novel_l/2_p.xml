<p id="Par8">The LP-PEDV G1b strains appear to have originated from a recombination event between a virus G1a as the minor parent and a virus G2b as the major parent (e.g. &gt; 99% sequence identity to G2b for the whole genome but ≤ 89% and 95% sequence identity to G2b and G1a, respectively, from nt 1 to 1,170 of S) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Their S genes contain typical genetic and phylogenetic features: identical length, no INDELs when compared to the historic G1a CV777 strain, and a different phylogenetic classification (G1b or G2) based on the sequence of the S gene or whole genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. All G1b isolates identified in this study possessed the aforementioned characteristics (Supplementary Fig. S2). When comparing the first 1,170 nt of the S1 NTD, the KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 strains have 93% and 88% sequence identity to G1a CV777 and G2b KNU-141112 strains, respectively. The genetic similarity between the full S gene sequences of the query G1a (consensus) strain and the G1b or G2b (consensus) isolates was plotted using SimPlot analysis. As expected, the sequence similarity of the first 1,170 nt of S was distinctly different between the G2b and KNU-1406 strains (Supplementary Fig. S3). Likewise, the same region showed the genetic distance between the G2b virus and the 2017 G1b isolates (KNU-1701, -1702, and -1707) identified in our previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, when the G2b and 2018–19 G1b (KNU-1808 and KNU-1909) strains were compared, their nucleotide sequences varied by approximately 690 nt, suggesting the emergence of new PEDV variants.
