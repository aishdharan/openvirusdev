<p id="Par9">The full genomes of the 2018–19 G1b strains were sequenced and analyzed to clarify the genetic origin of the novel G1b variants with respect to other domestic PEDV strains. Like other G1b viruses, the genomes of the KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 viruses were 28,029 nt in length, excluding the 3′ poly(A) tail, and no INDELs were identified throughout their entire genomes. The 2018–19 variants showed high overall sequence similarity to each other (99.8% identity) and with other global G1b PEDV strains (98.7–99.7% identity) (Supplementary Table S2). The number of nt or aa differences and the percent identity between the contemporary (2017–19) G1b isolates and their emergent (2014) strain KNU-1406 are summarized in Supplementary Table S3. Aligning the genome sequences of all G1b sequences revealed marked variation between the Korean emergent and contemporary G1b strains but clear similarity among the contemporary isolates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, the NTD of the S gene, which includes the first 1,170 nt residues and corresponds to nt 20,634 and nt 21,803 of the genome sequence, showed significant sequence homology among the emergent and contemporary G1b strains. These data indicate a potential for the occurrence of a novel recombination event.
