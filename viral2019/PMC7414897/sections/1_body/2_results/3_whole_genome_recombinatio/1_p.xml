<p id="Par10">To determine whether the 2017–19 G1b variants were new recombinants from field isolates, the RDP4 program was used to carry out an analysis based on a comparison between G1b strains and 20 Korean G2b isolates. Eight methods in the RDP4 software package were used to detect recombination events and breakpoints, and the results are summarized in Supplementary Table S4. Two putative recombination sites were detected between nt 20,661 and nt 22,597 in the genome of KNU-1702, corresponding to nt 28–1,964 of the S gene. All eight detection methods revealed that the major and minor parental viruses of the recombination event are the PEDV pandemic-like HP-G2b strain KNU-1703 (MH052682) and the LP-G1b strain KNU-1406, respectively (average 
 <italic>P</italic>-value, 1.76 × 10
 <sup>−25</sup>). Similarly, the recombination events in KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 were independently confirmed by all eight modules with a high degree of confidence (average 
 <italic>P</italic>-values, 7.95 × 10
 <sup>−20</sup> and 3.07 × 10
 <sup>−22</sup>, respectively), consistently indicating that KNU-1703 and KNU-1406 represent the backbone and inserted sequence, respectively. However, the genomes of the 2018–19 G1b variants all contained putative recombination points at nt 20,661 and nt 21,318 nt, corresponding to nt 28 and nt 684 in the S gene. Similarity plots showed high overall sequence similarity between the G1b recombinant and the parental G2b KNU-1703 strains, but the sequence similarity significantly decreased in the putative recombinant positions between nt 28 and nt 1,964, or nt 28 and nt 684 of the S gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Analogous to the S gene-based SimPlot data (Supplementary Fig. S3), all methods detected the truncated sequence endpoint for the 2018–19 G1b strains, which was predicted at nt 684 in the S gene. Interestingly, the 2018–19 recombinants had four unique substitutions (S232I, D242E, S243P, and L266V) within the truncated segment spanning nt 684–1,964 of the S gene when compared to that of other G1b strains, including KNU-1702. However, the changed amino acids were identical to those found in the G2b field isolates (Supplementary Fig. S2), possibly leading to the alteration of the sequence endpoint from nt 22,597 to nt 21,318 in the genome (or nt 1,964 to 684 in the S gene). Considering that the most recently identified G1b virus (KNU-1702) and the major parental virus (KNU-1703) were isolated in the same year, the inter-subgroup recombination event appears to have occurred in 2017. This event created the novel G1b variant, which in turn underwent point mutations in the S1 region that shifted it toward the more-G2b-like strain.
