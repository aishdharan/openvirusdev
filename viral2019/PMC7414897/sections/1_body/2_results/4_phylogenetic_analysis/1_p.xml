<p id="Par11">The complete S-gene-based phylogenetic analysis clearly segregated the PEDV strains in two genogroup clusters, G1 and G2, which were further defined into subgroups 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 strains still belonged to subgroup G1b, but they formed an independent clade with the 2017 G1b isolates within the same subgroup. However, they were positioned differently based on the phylogenies of their parental regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B–E). Whereas the minor parental region (the NTD encompassing nt 28–1,964, or nt 28–684 of the S gene) of the 2017–19 G1b strains showed a close relationship to G1b (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and C), the contemporary G1b viruses were grouped with G2b isolates in the phylogenetic tree based on the major parental region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D and E). In addition, a phylogenetic analysis of nt 684–1,964 of S revealed that only the 2018–19 G1b recombinants, excluding the 2017 G1b isolates, clustered together with the domestic G2b strains, including the major parental virus KNU-1703 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F). The whole-genome phylogeny indicated that the novel 2018–19 G1b recombinants were grouped with the global G1b strains within the G2 clade, but they produced a new branch close to the one containing the major parental G2b virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G).
