<p id="Par13">Although the Korean emergent G1b KNU-1406 strain was first detected in Gyeongbuk Province and subsequently spread across the country, the contemporary 2017–19 G1b recombinants and the major parental 2017 G2b viruses were identified in Chungcheong Province and the adjacent Gyeonggi Province (Supplementary Fig. S5). It is noteworthy that all of the pig farms where those 2017–19 G1b or G2b viruses were detected belong to the same farmers’ cooperative. Therefore, it is likely that the cooperative shared several farm-to-farm transmission sources, including traffic and humans, and that these transmission sources acted as an intermediate environment that provided favorable conditions for two circulating viruses (i.e. KNU-1406 and KNU-1703) to simultaneously or sequentially contaminate a single farm during the 2017 outbreaks. This generated a new G1b recombinant (i.e., KNU-1702), which continued to undergo non-lethal mutations and was probably dispersed throughout its associated farms (KNU-1808 and KNU-1909), possibly recovering G2b-like virulence. These types of circumstances may favor the emergence of new genotypes or variants in the domestic herd with greater pathogenicity than the prototype G1b and against which the current G2b vaccine may provide incomplete protection. Continuous surveillance for novel variants is paramount for RNA viruses, including PEDV, that have rapid evolutionary rates. Therefore, the present study underlines the importance of performing periodic monitoring and surveillance investigations, which aid in the development of vaccines against variant or new-genotype viruses that may cause future epidemics or pandemics. </p>
