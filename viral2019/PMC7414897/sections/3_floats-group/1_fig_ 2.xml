  <p>Recombination analyses of 2018–19 Korean PEDV G1b strains. The 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis indicates the genomic position, and the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis represents the pairwise identity between KNU-1406 and KNU-1703, KNU-1406 and KNU-1702, or KNU-1702 and KNU-1703 (top panel); between KNU-1406 and KNU-1703, KNU-1406 and KNU-1808, or KNU-1808 and KNU-1703 (middle panel); and between KNU-1406 and KNU-1703, KNU-1406 and KNU-1909, or KNU-1909 and KNU-1703 (bottom panel), illustrated with yellow, purple, and green lines, respectively. The beginning and end of each recombinant breakpoint is shaded grey and labeled with position numbers. A schematic diagram of the genomes of Korean G1b recombinants and a major parental virus KNU-1703 relative to the G2b consensus is depicted. The major parental region representing the backbone sequence of KNU-1703 is indicated by blue bars, while the minor parental region spanning the S1 NTD of KNU-1406 is indicated by red bars. The novel G1b variants identified in this study (KNU-1808 and KNU-1909) are indicated by an asterisk
