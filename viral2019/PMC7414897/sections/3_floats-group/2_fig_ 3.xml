  <p>Phylogenetic analysis based on (A) the full-length S genes, (B and C) minor parental regions covering nt 28–1,964 or nt 28–684 of S (corresponding to genomic nt positions 20,661–22,597 or 20,661–21,318, respectively), (D and E) major parental regions (i.e., the whole genome excluding nt 28–1,964 or nt 28–684 of S, respectively), (F) nt 684–1,964 of S (corresponding to genomic nt positions 21,319–22,597), and (G) complete genomes of the PEDV strains. In each case, the corresponding region of the TGEV genome was included as an outgroup. The numbers at each branch indicate bootstrap values greater than 50% based on 1000 replicates. The name of each strain and its country and year of isolation, GenBank accession number, genotype, and subgenotypes proposed in this study are shown. Red dots indicate the 2018–2019 G1b strains identified in this study, blue dots indicate the 2017 G1b strains identified in 2017, a green dot indicates the emergent Korean G1b strain identified in 2014, a red triangle indicates a major parental G2b virus identified in 2017, blue triangles indicate Korean G2b strains identified during 2017–19 outbreaks, and green triangles indicate Korean G2b strains identified during the 2013–14 pandemic. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site</p>
