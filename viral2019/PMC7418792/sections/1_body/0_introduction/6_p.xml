<p id="par0040">At inter-host level, adaptive mutations are essential for the newly emerging viruses in order to increase replication and facilitate onward transmission in the new hosts [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Particularly for MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the genetic diversity and frequent recombination events, lead to periodical emergence of new viruses capable of infecting a wide range of hosts [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Intra-host variability in viral infections, emerges from genomic phenomena taking place during error-prone replication, ending up to multiple circulating quasispecies of low or higher frequency [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These variants, in combination with the genetic profile of the host, can potentially influence the natural history of the infection, the viral phenotype, but also the sensitivity of molecular and serological diagnostics assays [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the case of flu epidemics for example, de novo arising mutations and intra-host diversity not only forms intra-host evolution of Influenza A, but also greatly affects the pathogenesis of the virus [

 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. Indeed, it is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants that emerge from inter- and intra-host evolution might be associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 [
