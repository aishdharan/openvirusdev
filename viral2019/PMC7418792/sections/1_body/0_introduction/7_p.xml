<p id="par0045">Viruses have developed multiple adaptive strategies to counteract the host immunological response, which are subject to inter- and intra-host selection pressures; “Selfish” strategies confer a selective advantage in a particular quasispecies, impair the immune response inside the infected cell and evolve by intra-host selection, while neutral or “unselfish” defence strategies impair the immune response outside the infected cell and evolve by inter-host selection, preferentially in viruses with low mutation rates [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is moderate and similar to other RNA viruses (0.00084 per site per year) [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but still generally higher compared to DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, most of the suggested immune escape mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 involve intra-cellular interactions [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], thus expected to evolve by intra-host selective pressure. These observations highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 intra-host variability in the frame of viral evolution and host-pathogen interactions.
