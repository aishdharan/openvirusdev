<p id="par0085">The comparison of all SNVs (intra-host and population level) with the genomic targets of the molecular diagnostics assays, revealed colocalization of 3 intra-host SNVs and 2 isolate-specific SNVs with primers and probes currently in use in RdRP_SARSr, HKU-N, 2019-nCoV-N1 and 2019-nCoV-N2 diagnostic reactions (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). The thermodynamic assessment of these SNVs revealed variable impact on the binding affinity of the corresponding primers and probes on the mutated genomic region (Suppl. Table 2)
