 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the viral genomes was almost complete for samples SRR10903401 and SRR10903402 covering 99.7 % of the genome with 4 overlapping contigs and 99.5 % of the genome with a single contig, respectively. The de novo assembly of sample SRR10971381 was complete, with one contig covering 100 % of the genome. Alternative contigs revealed intra-host genomic rearrangements

 <italic>de novo</italic> assembled contigs, setting a threshold of at least 5 supporting reads of high mapping quality (&gt;40) in each case. For sample SRR10903401 three inversions/misassemblies in ORF1ab (Suppl. Fig. 1) and one inversion/misassembly in S gene (

 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-B). Apart from 2 inversions in ORF1ab supported by only 2 reads each (not passing the validation threshold), there were no further large-scale intra-host events observed for sample SRR10903402. Similarly, one inversion/misassembly in sample SRR10971381 that was supported by only one read was identified. The alignment coordinates of all rearrangement-supporting contigs with respect to the reference strain are presented in
