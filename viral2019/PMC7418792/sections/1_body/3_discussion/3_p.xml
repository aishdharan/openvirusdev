<p id="par0100">All samples analysed in this study were probably infected by the same viral strain since they shared the same set of consensus SNVs. However, apart from 3 intra-host SNVs that were common between SRR10903401 and SRR10903402, there was no other overlap observed between the low frequency variants of each sample (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-B). This indicates that these variations have occurred in a rather random fashion and are not subject to selective pressures, which is also supported by the fact that the missense mutations were systematically more, compared to the synonymous mutations [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. On the other hand, missense substitutions are more common in loci involving pathogen resistance, indicating positive selection [
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The analysed viral RNA might have originated from functional/packed virions, but also from unpacked viral genomes, unable to replicate and infect other host cells. Even if a viral genome is unable to replicate independently, its abundant presence in the pool of viral quasispecies implies some functionality regarding the intra-host evolution and adaptation. For example, defective viral genomes might affect infection dynamics such as viral persistence as well as the natural history of the infection [

 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At the same time, these variants may arise rapidly during an outbreak and can be used for tracking the transmission chains and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the epidemic [
