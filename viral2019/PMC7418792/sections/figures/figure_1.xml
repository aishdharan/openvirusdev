  <p>Intra – host SNVs: (A) Intra host SNV frequency vs sequencing read depth (X coverage) in the corresponding alignment position. (B) Venn diagram representing unique and common SNVs isolated from the three patients (C) Boxplot of intra-host SNVs frequency vs. SNV type – synonymous, missense, nonsense (stop gained) (low, moderate and high impact respectively). Average values are in red rhombs. (D) Intra-host SNVs frequency vs. all seven genes affected (ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, N). Average values are in red rhombs. (E) Density histogram of intra-host SNVs isolated from all patients (total number of SNVs / 100 bp - blue bars) and average sequencing read depth (X coverage – green line), across the SARS-CoV-2 genome map (genes in orange, 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions in light blue).
