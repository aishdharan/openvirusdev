 <caption> Alignment of the de novo assembled contigs on the genomic map (bottom). Concordantly aligned contigs (correct or gapped) are in green, while discordantly aligned contigs are in red. Sequencing read depth (X coverage) across the genome (blue histograms) and relative % GC content (green line) is presented for each sample. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). </caption>
