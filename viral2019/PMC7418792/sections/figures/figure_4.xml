  <p>Recombination events in S gene. Samples (A) SRR10903401 and (B) SRR10903402. Alignments of the de novo assembled contigs with respect to the reference genome (MN 975262). Donor â€“ acceptor palindrome sequences are indicated in green bars. Raw, non-duplicated NGS reads, validating the recombination event, are represented below the corresponding contig. (C): Prediction of the secondary structure of the genomic region spanning the rearrangement breakpoint (100 bases upstream and 100 bases downstream). The corresponding donor- acceptor sequences, exposed in internal loops, are indicated in green bars. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).</p>
