<p>The European Commission periodically classifies viruses on their occupational hazards â€“ that is, the risks they entail for workers. This classification defines the level of health and safety protection from exposure to viruses at work that workers are entitled to claim. Viruses belonging to Group 3 can cause severe human disease and hazard to workers, as well as a risk of spreading to the community, but there is usually effective prophylaxis or treatment available. Group 4 viruses are similarly defined, except there is usually no effective prophylaxis or treatment available.

 </sup> The European trade unions and the European Commission are negotiating the classification of the COVID-19 virus along these 2 categories. This article weighs the reasons to classify it in Group 3 or 4 while comparing COVID-19 risks to those of the most significant viruses classified in these 2 categories. Beyond the degree of protection that it justifies, the usefulness of the comparison stems from the fact that it makes it possible to weight various epidemiological and medical indicators from a public health perspective.
