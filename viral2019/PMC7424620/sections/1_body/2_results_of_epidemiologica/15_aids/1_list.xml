HIV prevalence was highest in the East of the Region (44.8 per 100,000 population), lower in the West and in the [European Union/European Economic Area] (6.0 and 5.6 per 100,000, respectively) and lowest in the Centre (3.3 per 100,000). The number of people newly diagnosed with HIV in the WHO European Region has increased by 22% over the last decade, while the number of new diagnoses among countries in the [European Union/European Economic Area] has declined by 17% since 2009. In 2018, just over half (53%) of those diagnosed with HIV in the European Region were diagnosed at a late stage of infection.”
