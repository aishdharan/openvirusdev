   </sup> testing, tracing contacts, and isolation. With regard to treatment, Remdesivir would reduce the sickness episode duration, but its effect on the risk of dying was not demonstrated in 1 study
   <sup>

   </sup> Hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 would not be effective,
   <sup>
    <xref rid="bibr11-0020731420946590" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
   </sup> but it is too early to hold definitive conclusions as it is a combined treatment (hydroxychloroquine + azythromycin) that would have yielded the results in Marseilles and, furthermore, it has been advocated for early uses.

  <p>As of May 10, 2020, there were 3,986,119 cases and 278,814 deaths; and 15,685,177 cases and 637,231 deaths as of July 24, 2020.

  <p>The CFR was quite variable according to country (
   <xref rid="table1-0020731420946590" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
   <sup>
    <xref rid="bibr13-0020731420946590" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
   </sup> Notice that during an outbreak of a pandemic, the CFR is a poor measure of the mortality risk of the disease because the denominator tends to increase more rapidly as more people are tested. Inter-country comparisons are also misleading, especially between small and large countries, because in large countries the epidemic concentrates regionally
   <sup>
    <xref rid="bibr14-0020731420946590" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
   </sup> and because of large differences in testing capabilities, leading to the impossibility of knowing the actual numbers of cases, most of them being asymptomatic. Excess deaths (as a percent above normal, established on the average of 5 previous years) is a better indicator.

 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Early testing, tracking, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine explain part of the impact in Germany (3% excess deaths against 72% and 56% in the United Kingdom and Spain, respectively; see 
   <xref rid="table1-0020731420946590" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), as do the number of intensive care unit beds per 100,000 population (33.9 in Germany, 15.9 in Belgium, 12.5 in Italy, and 9.7 in Spain).
   <sup>
    <xref rid="bibr15-0020731420946590" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
   </sup> Hypothetically, this difference could explain why nursing home residents were more easily hospitalized in Germany: The proportion of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes would increase when the capacity of intensive care units is reduced.

 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>As with CFR, it is too early to compute the disease-specific mortality rate. However, it can already be observed that mortality in the countries where it is the highest is explained by poorer planning of epidemic control (tracing, testing, isolation, masks) and by a hospital system and nursing homes whose resources have been cut by austerity policies or that are insufficiently accessible because of the commercial financing of health systems
   <sup>
    <xref rid="bibr16-0020731420946590" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
   </sup> – good planning possibly compensating partially for the other factors. Geographical, demographical, social, economic, political, and cultural variations from country to country can also explain part of the differences in the epidemic transmission (R0), thereby affecting incidence and mortality.

  <p>What are the reasons to believe that workplaces are important to the dissemination of COVID-19 in the general population? Health care
   <sup>
    <xref rid="bibr17-0020731420946590" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
   </sup> and nursing home workers are well-known disseminators in high-risk populations. Sixty-one percent of people with COVID-19 investigated in New Zealand clusters were in work environment clusters (
   <xref rid="table2-0020731420946590" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

   </sup> In Belgium, as of May 5, 53% of deaths occurred in residential homes for the elderly, against 47% in hospitals.
   <sup>
    <xref rid="bibr19-0020731420946590" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
   </sup> Moreover, the CFR in residential homes for the elderly was 54.7%. (In order to be as complete as possible in reporting the pandemic, the Belgian government includes suspected cases in its deaths count. By April 15, the total number of reported deaths since the beginning of the pandemic was 4,440. The confirmed cases were almost exclusively those in the hospitals and reached 2,264 so far.) While the government restricted parents’ access to these homes, it allowed positive-tested workers and professionals to continue working there. The distribution of cases in Germany (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020731420946590">Figure 2</xref>) shows a higher incidence in the working-age population than in the 60–80 age group and a steep increase in the age groups at retirement homes. The moderately higher incidence in females could mirror their higher presence in social services. Occupational risks for COVID-19 were recognized early on.

   </sup> Finally, a large array of publications suggest that there is a disproportionate COVID-19 burden on working classes in every country where it has been investigated – for example, in France

   </sup> and Korea.
