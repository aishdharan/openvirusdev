<p>The list of studied viral pathologies may be incomplete from a public health significance perspective. The provided statistics only give an order of magnitude, and this is how we used them to draw our conclusions, especially since it is too early to estimate the R0 and CFR of COVID-19. In addition, countries declare the disease heterogeneously. Some demand a test, others suggestive symptoms, while others do not count deaths in nursing homes. Data on the period-to-period difference in mortality between 2020 and previous years are only beginning to emerge; to enable inter-country comparisons, the COVID-19 mortality will have to be assessed through excess mortality rates, by comparing overall country-specific, monthly mortality rates to the previous 5-year average mortality rate of the same month.</p>
