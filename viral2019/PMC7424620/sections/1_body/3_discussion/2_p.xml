<p>Pooled mortality estimates from the EuroMOMO network continue to show a markedly increased level of excess all-cause mortality overall for participating European countries, coinciding with the current COVID-19 pandemic. This overall excess mortality is driven by a very substantial excess mortality in some countries, while other countries have had no excess mortality. The mortality excess is primarily seen in the age group of ≥65 years, but also in the age group of 15–64 years. For the EuroMOMO network as a whole, from Week 10 in 2020 and as of Week 18, there were 149,447 excess deaths estimated in total, including 137,524 in the age group ≥65 years and 11,573 in the 15–64 years age group. This time period includes part of the influenza season as well as the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
