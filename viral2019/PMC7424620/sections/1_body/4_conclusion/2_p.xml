<p>Among the studied diseases in Group 3, HVB and HVC (Hepatitis B and C), H2N2, and HIV (AIDS) represent a public health risk to E.U. citizens. The others are either absent or exceptional in Europe. HBV, HBC, H2N2, and HIV, however, have an effective treatment and/or prophylaxis â€“ unlike COVID-19. On this criterion, the key one that distinguishes Groups 3 and 4, COVID-19 should be classified in Group 4.</p>
