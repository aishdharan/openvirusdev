<p>What would be the consequences on COVID classification if Ebola, Lassa, and Marburg fevers were actually found in Europe? Basically, our conclusion would remain valid because the COVID-19 R0 is superior to the R0 of these pathologies and their incidence is so low that although their CFR is superior, the mortality of these 3 diseases would remain vastly inferior to the COVID-19 mortality.</p>
