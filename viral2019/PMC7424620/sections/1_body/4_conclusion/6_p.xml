<p>While most of the studied viruses concentrate on health care workers and workers in contact with animals, COVID-19 has a wide distribution that concerns jobs in essential sectors (nurses, midwives, physicians, caregivers, child minders, home helpers, paramedical professions, social work and guidance professionals, army, police, firefighters, cashiers, etc.).
