<p id="par0045">Jiangjunshan Hospital is the only designated hospital for COVID-19 treatment in Guizhou, with a cure rate of 98.64% (145/147). There are two units in the ICU, including an isolation room and a staff personal protective equipment (PPE) dressing room. The infection prevention and control protocols for each unit include wearing PPE and changing gloves between units that are not removed before exiting the unit, limiting entry and exit into the ICU by staff, and outfitting all units with negative pressure equipment. The ICU was routinely cleaned three times daily at 7:00, 12:00, and 17:00. Routine cleaning included sweeping the floor, wiping the tables with 1,000 mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant, clearing rubbish, and sterilizing the indoor air for 30 min using an ozone disinfection machine. Additionally, the surfaces of all objects were wiped using 75% medicinal alcohol when staff were free.</p>
