<p id="par0060">To evaluate the efficacy of routine cleaning, we used sterile synthetic fibre swabs with plastic shafts to collect surface environmental samples. Swabs were premoistened with viral transport media and wiped over the surface of the object for a few seconds and then placed immediately into sterile tubes containing 3â€‰mL of viral transport media. Each swab was collected independently to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
