<p id="par0080">In this study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 particles were present in the air of an isolation room in the ICU. The findings agreed with those reported by other studies that found that SARS-CoV-2 was present in indoor air (Yuanfang J, 2020;

 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Joshua L. Santarpia, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Liu, 2020</xref>). This result is an underlying piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our findings constituted the first piece of environmental evidence that patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 may still be shedding the virus. Since reported median estimates of the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols range from approximately 1.1 to 1.2 hours (95% confidence intervals of 0.64 to 2.64) (
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">van Doremalen et al., 2020</xref>), our samples were taken 48 hours after the patient had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and two hours after the last disinfection operation at Jiangjunshan Hospital. It may be inferred that the aerial presence of SARS-CoV-2 in our study was not a result of retention. It is known that recovered patients who are still discharging the virus may have an increased risk of RP. Although the reason for RP remains unclear, potential major factors include virology, immunology, and sampling methodologies. A recent pathological research report found that SARS-CoV-2 could remain in the lung tissue of a ready-for-discharge patient (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2020</xref>), and we believe this study also supported the current virologic understanding of RP occurrence among COVID-19 patients, i.e., the false negatives caused by faulty sampling methodologies, viral residues in the patient’s body, intermittent viral release in the patient’s body (Xing Y-H, 2020), and viral distribution (

 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Xia, Tong, Liu, Shen, &amp; Guo, 2020</xref>). Negative nasopharyngeal swab tests may result in disregarding the above factors. Another study reported that supplementing negative results with an anal swab test at discharge failed to reduce RP occurrence in COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Liao, An, &amp; Xuejiao, 2020</xref>). This study also analysed the differences in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody levels in both RP and non-RP patients at the time of discharge but did not find any significant differences. According to the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (sixth edition) published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">China, 2020b</xref>), the discharge criteria for recovered patients included a return to normal temperature for more than three days, a significant improvement in respiratory symptoms, a significant absorption of pulmonary lesions on chest CT imaging, and at least two consecutive negative RNA test results conducted at least 24 hours apart. As a result, some recovered patients discharged under the current standards are likely to retain SARS-CoV-2 in their lung tissue and may continue shedding it, which may cause new infections after patient discharge and increase the risk of infection transmission in cities. Therefore, our research contributes to the environmental evidence supporting the virologic hypothesis of RP occurrence in COVID-19 patients. We suggest considering the following measures to improve the current discharge standards and disease management of recovered COVID-19 patients. First, stricter protective measures should be taken for the medical staff and close contacts of recovered COVID-19 patients. Second, the clinical and disease management guidelines for discharged COVID-19 patients need to be improved, including extending the detection time prior to discharge. Pulmonary lesions on chest CT imaging, consecutive negative RNA results of nasopharyngeal and anal swab tests, serological testing, clinical features, and natural history of the infection should all be considered before discharging a patient. Continuous air monitoring around recovered COVID-19 patients should be combined with monitoring viral particles in patients' bodies to determine whether complete viral clearance has been achieved. Third, both the sensitivity and specificity of detection kits need to be improved to reduce false negatives.
