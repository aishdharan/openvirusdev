 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2020</xref>), which may be due to differences in routine cleaning operations that could lead to different levels of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment; for example, the frequency of disinfection at Jiangjunshan Hospital was higher than that reported in other locations (

 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, the number and density of patients in the ICU at Jiangjunshan Hospital were much lower than those at other hospitals, indicating a markedly reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in the environment. Moreover, many studies have shown that factors such as temperature and humidity can affect the spread of the virus in enclosed indoor environments (

 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Some studies reported that the rate in which SARS-CoV-2 spread was accelerated in cold and dry conditions (Casanova, Jeon, Rutal, Weber, &amp; Sobsey, 2010; Chin, Chu, Perera, Hui, &amp; Poon, 2020). Within an infected person, respiratory droplets with high humidity are produced under high humidity conditions by the atomization of human secretions containing the virus as they pass the air passage through out lung during coughing and sneezing. These droplets undergo size reduction due to the drying of water content if the surrounding air humidity and temperature are very low. In contrast, the size of the droplet is not reduced if the surrounding air humidity and temperature are high (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Chen, Liu, Lin, &amp; Chen, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Liu, Wei, Li, &amp; Ooi, 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Wu, Zhang, &amp; Zhang, 2016</xref>). At the same time, the virus could become diluted with the surrounding water content in the air and become less active. Therefore, a humid environment may be beneficial for maintaining droplet size and reducing viral activity and may therefore play a larger role than the temperature of the indoor environment where a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient is located. In our study, the relative humidity in the ICU at Jiangjunshan Hospital was 45%, which may imply that the droplets shed by the ready-for-discharge patient may undergo size reduction due to the surrounding air conditions being dry. As the expiratory droplet size of the SARS-CoV-2 distribution had a peak size between 0.25 and 1.0 μm (
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Liu, 2020</xref>), viruses with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 0.5 μm can remain suspended in the air instead of quickly settling onto the surfaces of objects, and exhaled droplet nuclei can be transmitted between occupants via the airborne route (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Ai, Huang, &amp; Melikov, 2019</xref>). Additionally, although our sampling was performed two hours after the last routine cleaning, the frequency of disinfection of object surfaces was higher than that of the air in the ICU at Jiangjunshan Hospital, which may have resulted in the air samples but not the object surfaces testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. To solve the problem of the long-term presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral aerosols in enclosed environments and reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we believe that it is necessary to increase the frequency of indoor air disinfection and to keep the relative humidity of the indoor environment at a high level to maintain droplet size, thereby reducing viral activity.
