<p id="par0090">Our study has several limitations. First, viral cultures were not performed to demonstrate its viability. Second, the sample size was small due to the low incidence of COVID-19 in Guizhou Province. Moreover, due to the lack of consumables (air collection tubes), our research began during the late stage of the epidemic in Guizhou, and we were unable to continue performing air sample tests. The concentration of airborne SARS-CoV-2 was not quantified. The aerodynamic size distribution of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols was not evaluated. Additional studies are needed to confirm our observations.</p>
