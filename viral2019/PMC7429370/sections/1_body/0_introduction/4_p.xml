<p id="Par5">Based on the model, we find that migration control was extremely effective in controlling the spread of the epidemic. If the government continues strict migration control, the infections numbers of most cities in China would peak between mid-February to early March 2020. The peak number of infections in most cities is smaller than 100, while the proportion of infected individuals in each cities population is smaller than 0.01%. However, if the epidemic spreading is out of control, it would infect about 1% of the population in Hubei province, while infecting about 0.3% population outside Hubei province. The peak number of infections in most cities would come at the end of April 2020. Evidence shows that China has controlled the spreading of COVID-19.</p>
