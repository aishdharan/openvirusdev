<p id="Par14">Testing is the only way to know whether a susceptible individual is infected or not. At present, there exist two kinds of tests (techniques) for testing COVID-19. One kind of tests (techniques) checks the presence of the COVID-19 virus, aiming to establish whether an individual is currently infected. The other kind of tests examines the presence of antibodies, which can figure out whether an individual has been infected in the past, even this individual has recovered and not carried COVID-19 virus now. A summary of the current state of testing technologies associated with their implementations can be found in [

In this work, the official number of infected cases only contains individual who has a positive COVID-19 testing result. In China, Wuhan is received the first confirmed case of COVID-19 infection on December 8, 2019 [

The data of COVID-19 infections, recovery, and death toll used in the study were derived from official data released by the National Health Commission of China. Hubei Province was the epicenter of the epidemic in China. Most of the infections occurred in Hubei Province (as shown in Fig.
