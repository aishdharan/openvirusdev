<p id="Par16">COVID-19 mainly spread through human-to-human transmission. In this case, the intercity migration of infected and exposed individuals has become the main driving force for COVID-19 to spread from one city to another. Chinese New Year (mid-January to early February 2020) is the most important holiday for Chinese people. In 2020, the period around during the Spring Festival holiday in 2019 is approximately from mid-January to early February 2020. Wuhan, as one of the most important transportation hubs in China and the world, is one of the cities with the largest flow of entry and exit around the Spring Festival. China’s Ministry of Transport estimates that Wuhan has about 5 million trips, while China as a whole has about 3 billion trips during the Spring Festival holiday. We have collected daily intercity travel data for 367 cities in China. The data provide the intensity of population migration and also indicate the strength of the population in and out of various cities. Based on these data, we can develop the migration networks (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government has rapidly restricted the intercity migration since January 23, so the strength of intercity migration has dramatically reduced since January 23. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the total inflow/outflow of travelers of 6 metropolis in Chinese. Note that after migration control, the strength of the intercity migration of Wuhan has almost reduced to zero. The control measure effectively reduced the speed of virus transmission and ultimately successfully controlled the further spread of the virus.
