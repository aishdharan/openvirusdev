<p id="Par31">The National Health Committee of China has published data on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic from January 20, 2020. We use these historical data for parameter estimation of the SEIR-migration model (
 <xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="">6</xref>). The pseudocoevolutionary simulated annealing algorithm, as described in Sect.Â 
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref>, is adopted to find the optimal parameter set of this model. Since the parameters of the model are all estimated from historical data through reverse engineering techniques, the accuracy and integrity of the data are essential. In the early stage of COVID-19, people do not know much about this virus, and the diagnostic techniques are limited. Therefore, during the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, the historical data of Wuhan City are possible to deviate from the true value in a wide range. Hence, we reduce the weighting coefficients corresponding to Wuhan data in the objective function. In addition, after the outbreak of the epidemic, Chinese government has adopted effective quarantine measures and promoted epidemic prevention knowledge. These measures can effectively reduce the infection rate in each city. Therefore, the parameters in the model should be time-varying. Nevertheless, to simplify the calculation, we assume that these parameters are constant over the whole process. We also applied traditional simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and pattern search method to estimate the parameters of the model. However, these methods cannot provide a satisfied result or cannot even converge in an acceptable computation time (such as one day), while the proposed method can converge to the global optima in two hours.
