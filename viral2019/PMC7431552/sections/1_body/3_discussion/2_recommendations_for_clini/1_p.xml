<p id="Par6">The risk of contamination is very high in upper respiratory examinations. In Chinese patients, SARS-Cov-2 was detected in 63% of nasopharyngeal swabs, in 46% of the fiberoptic bronchoscopic brush biopsies and in 93% of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens. Higher viral loads were detected in the nose than in the throat. In spite of that, recommendations for clinical and endoscopic examination can be very controversial because adequate PPE to all staff involved in patient care cannot be available everywhere. Disruption of supply chains and depletion of stock of PPE can drive anxiety in health professionals [

Head and neck surgeons, otolaryngologists, maxillofacial surgeons, and anesthetists are at high risk of contamination and infection by SARS-CoV-2 when assisting patients with tracheostomy or performing a rhinoscopy or a laryngoscopy because of the generation of aerosols. Fortunately, tracheostomy is unlikely to be required for the majority of patients. All patients must be examined by ENT surgeon wearing PPE such as N95 or FFP2 mask or PAPR, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves (Table
