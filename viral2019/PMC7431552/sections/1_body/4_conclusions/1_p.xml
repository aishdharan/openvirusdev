<p id="Par8">The world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lessons learned include increased risks of transmission to otolaryngologists, oral maxillofacial surgeons, dentists, and anesthesiologists; and tactics to limit the risk of spread. In our sector it is required to know about COVIDâ€“19 but its our job to train the staff and the patients attending the OPDs or any other procedures. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. ENT surgeries should be postponed if not urgent.</p>
