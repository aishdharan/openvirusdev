<p id="p0010">As a result of the clinical similarity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with other flulike syndromes, patients were tested for other pathogens of respiratory tract infections as well, especially in the first weeks of the epidemic. In those weeks, we used the multiplex PCR BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia panel (BioFire Diagnostics; bioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France), allowing the detection of 33 respiratory pathogens with a run time of 1 hour. Here we report the aetiologic pattern of respiratory tract infections diagnosed at the Amedeo di Savoia Hospital, the regional reference centre for infectious diseases of Piedmont, north-western Italy, during the first weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>
