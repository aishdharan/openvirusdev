<p id="p0015">We retrospectively reviewed clinical and microbiologic records generated via routine clinical practice (ethical approval not required) from 162 consecutive patients (93 male; median age, 64 years; range, 12–93 years) from 12 February to 31 March 2020 with respiratory symptoms who were screened with FilmArray and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis after multiple sample collection in Copan UTM transport medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy). For the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific RNA, a multiplex Real Time PCR Kit (Liferiver, San Diego, CA, USA) was used (detection limit, 1 × 10³ copies/mL). The kit measures three virus genes simultaneously: SARS-CoV-2 gene E, N and ORF1ab. The ABI Prism 7500 thermal cycler was used for PCR amplification (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) [
