<p id="p0025">FilmArray results were positive in 10 of 56 SARS-CoV-2–infected patients (17.8% vs. 50% in SARS-CoV-2–negative samples, χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 15.9, p &lt;0.001); interestingly, no other virus was found in SARS-CoV-2–positive patients (0 vs. 20.7%, χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 13.4, p &lt;0.001), but only Staphylococcus aureus (7/10), Haemophilus influenzae (2/10), Escherichia coli (2/10), Moraxella catarrhalis, group B streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (1/10 each), most probably as a result of colonization or bacterial superinfection in two COVID-19 patients whose bronchoaspirate tested positive for Haemophilus influenzae plus Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively (
