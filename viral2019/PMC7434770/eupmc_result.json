    "Background The response to the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic culminated in mandatory isolation throughout the world, with nation-wide confinement orders issued to decrease viral spread. These drastic measures were successful in \"flattening the curve\" and maintaining the prior rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths. To date, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on neuro-trauma has not been reported. Methods We retrospectively analyzed hospital admissions from Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, during the months of March and April from 2016-2020. Specifically, we identified all patients who had cranial neuro trauma consisting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or skull fractures, as well as spinal neuro trauma consisting of vertebral fractures and/or spinal cord injury (SCI). We then performed chart review to determine mechanism of injury and if emergent surgical intervention was required. Results Compared to previous years, we saw a significant decline in the number of neuro-traumas during the pandemic, with a 62% decline after the lockdown began. The number of emergent neuro-trauma surgical cases also significantly decreased by 84% in the month of April. Interestingly, while the number of vehicular traumas decreased by 77%, there was a significant 100% increase in the number of gunshot wounds. Conclusions Population seclusion had a direct effect on the frequency of neuro-trauma, while the change in relative proportion of certain mechanisms may be associated with the psychosocial effects of social distancing and quarantine."
