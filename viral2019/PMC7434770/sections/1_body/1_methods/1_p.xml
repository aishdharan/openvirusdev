<p id="p0015">After obtaining approval for this retrospective study from the University of Miami institutional review board, we queried the registry at Ryder Trauma Center to obtain a list of patients from 2016 to 2020 who sustained neurotrauma during the time frame of March 1 to April 30, 2020. Neurotrauma was defined as patients with traumatic brain injury, skull fractures, spinal cord injury, and vertebral fractures. Chart review was then performed to obtain variables such as age, sex, mechanism of injury, type of injury, and need for emergent surgery. Mechanisms of injury included assaults, bicycle accidents, ground-level falls (sitting, standing), falls from height (ladder, roof, multiple stories), gunshot wounds (GSWs), motorcycle collisions, motor vehicle collisions, pedestrian hit by car (PHBC), and other (boating, jet-ski, diving). Emergent surgery included procedures such as craniotomy, craniectomy, elevation of depressed skull fracture, skull-base repair for leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, laminectomy for spinal decompression, and instrumented fusions for spinal instability. Data sources included hospital charts and imaging studies.</p>
