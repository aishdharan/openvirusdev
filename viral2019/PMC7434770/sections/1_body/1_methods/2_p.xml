<p id="p0020">Data from the previous years 2016–2019 were used to establish baselines for statistical analysis. The absolute number of neurotrauma consults, surgeries, and mechanisms of injury in 2020 were compared with previous monthly averages and analyzed by Poisson regression analysis. The relative differences in proportion of mechanisms of injury in 2020 were compared before monthly averages by χ
 <sup>2</sup> proportion analysis. All statistical analysis was accomplished on GraphPad Prism 8 scientific software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA).
