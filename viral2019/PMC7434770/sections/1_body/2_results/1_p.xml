<p id="p0025">Overall, we found a significant difference in the average number of monthly neurotrauma consults from 2016 to 2019, with 83.5 ± 4.7 in March and 68.0 ± 8.8 in April (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.048, Student 
 <italic>t</italic> test). However, in March 2020 we saw a 20% decrease in total neurotrauma consults, which was significantly lower (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.036, Poisson analysis) than previous years (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ). This declining trend continued in April 2020, with the number of neurotrauma consults decreasing significantly by 62% (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001, Poisson analysis), after a statewide “stay-at-home” order was issued on April 1, 2020 (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0004, Poisson analysis) in April 2020 (
