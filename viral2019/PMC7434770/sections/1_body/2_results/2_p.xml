<p id="p0030">We then evaluated the mechanisms of injury for monthly neurotrauma consults and found no significant difference from 2016 to 2020. However, with only 28% of consults in 2020 coming in April, results may have been masked by normal proportions in March. When assessed individually, we found several differences in mechanisms of injury between March and April 2020 (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> ). Although absolute numbers of nearly all mechanisms of injury declined compared with previous-year averages, the relative proportion of each mechanism did not. As expected, the proportion of motorcycle collisions, motor vehicle collisions, and bicycle accidents decreased by 4%, 10%, and 3% respectively. In addition, the proportion of ground-level falls resulting in neurotrauma decreased by 6%, whereas the proportion of falls from height increased by 6%. There was also a nonsignificant 2% increase in the proportion of assaults. Surprisingly, there was a 6% increase in the proportion of PHBC and a 12% significant increase (
