  <p>Effect of lockdown on neurotrauma mechanisms. When comparing the relative proportions of mechanisms of injury between April 2020 and previous years, there were decreases in motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), motorcycle collisions (MCCs), bicycle accidents, and ground-level falls, and other (boating, jet-ski, diving) and increases in pedestrian hit by car (PHBC), falls from height (ladders, roof, multiple stories), assaults, and gunshot wounds (GSWs). Only GSWs had a significant proportional increase from 3% to 15% (
