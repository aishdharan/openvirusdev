Several epidemics have occurred in the history of China. But, fortunately, no large numbers of casualties have occurred, due to the prevalence of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). During the epidemic period of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), TCM played a vital role in fighting the epidemic (<xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">Luo&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), and the Chinese medical community accumulated valuable TCM experience (<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Li&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Liu&#x000a0;and Wang,&#x000a0;2004</xref>). What is the essence of infectious diseases? Is it possible to cure the disease as long as the virus is eliminated? TCM believes that the essence of infectious diseases is not viruses, but &#x0201c;grumpiness.&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Grumpiness&#x0201d; is a kind of evil that appears at the same time as abnormal weather. &#x0201c;Grumpiness&#x0201d; has the characteristics of strong pathogenicity, strong infectivity, entry route to human body through the mouth and nose, and specific lesion location. The current research data show that the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was prevalent in Wuhan in December 2019 (<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">Cui&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Li&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>b; <xref rid="bib0094" ref-type="bibr">Zhu&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), has the characteristics of an epidemic due to its infectiousness, which is in line with the category of &#x0201c;plague&#x0201d; in febrile disease. SARS-CoV2 can be understood as the &#x0201c;outcry&#x0201d; in Wen Xie, which is of great significance for screening susceptible people.</p><p id="para0006">A current meta-analysis also showed that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients are fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), and dyspnea (21.9%). The minor symptoms include headache or dizziness (12.1%), diarrhea (4.8%), and nausea and vomiting (3.9%) (<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Li&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>a). The data showed that although patients with COVID-19 had fever (mainly in the early stage of disease), the fever was not high and had the characteristic of &#x0201c;heat not rising.&#x0201d; In addition, patients have symptoms such as fatigue, tiredness, diarrhea, and thickly coated tongue (Tian et&#x000a0;al., 2020), which are consistent with the characteristics of heavy turbidity, stickiness, and depression in TCM. According to TCM, &#x0201c;wet poison&#x0201d; is caused by the combination of evil inside and outside. Thus, people who are cold or wet are very susceptible to the virus. In addition, sex workers may be heavily affected.</p><p id="para0007">The spread of infectious disease among health care workers during an epidemic is another consequence of its widespread distribution. What has become absolutely clear is that the use of isolation clothing, masks, and eye masks is an effective method to prevent the spread. However, this method puts stress on the supply of materials for this equipment. If there is widespread need, and the protective articles are not replaced in a timely way, infection of medical staff may occur. However, none of the medical staff was infected in the TCM hospitals or when using TCM methods (<xref rid="bib0064" ref-type="bibr">Xian&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). The medical staff consumed a Ganjiang Gancao decoction or other preventive prescriptions to prevent the infectious disease. This gratifying result was confirmed in the prevention and treatment of SARS in 2003 (Luo et&#x000a0;al., 2020). Youke Wu, a famous Chinese medicine practitioner in the Qing Dynasty of China, systematically furthered the understanding and treatment of infectious diseases and completed the first monograph on infectious diseases of TCM, entitled &#x0201c;Plague Theory&#x0201d;. In view of the law of transmission of infectious diseases, it is believed that the progress of the disease in the human body can be divided into four steps: defense, qi, nutrient, and blood. These steps can be used to summarize the superficial and deep levels of pathological changes and the severity of these changes. Wei Fen syndrome belongs to the category of exogenous exterior syndrome, which is the initial stage of pathological changes caused by exogenous heat evil invading the human body. Qi Fen syndrome refers to the stage of abnormal qi movement in human viscera or tissues without blood circulation. In Wei Fen and Qi Fen, the disease location is mainly in the lung, stomach, intestine, and gallbladder, and most of these diseases are functional disorders of the human body. Ying Fen syndrome refers to the stage of pathogenic heat in Ying Fen caused by the invasion of pathogenic heat. The stage of main pathological change is burning Ying Yin, which is the third stage of pathological change caused by the invasion of pathogenic factors. Blood Fen syndrome refers to the development of pathogenic heat to blood Fen, resulting in hyperactivity of blood heat. Blood consumption is a stage of major pathological change and the fourth stage in the course of disease. The main pathological change in this stage is organ parenchyma damage. This four-step TCM method of defense, qi, nutrient, and blood explains why no case progressed from mild to severe in the treatment of COVID-19 by TCM (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>

The pathogens associated with these diseases are all coronaviruses. But, TCM does not consider viruses to be the main cause of infectious diseases. As long as the disease is cured, the virus will die out naturally. Further, a negative virus test does not indicate recovery. COVID-19 belongs to the category of &#x02018;epidemic&#x02019; disease in TCM (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Wang&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Plagues have their own properties, and a plague corresponds to a nature (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Yang&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>).</p><p id="para0010">COVID-19 was categorized as a cold and dampness epidemic (<xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">Sun&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>), and the pathogenic factors are found in the body's mucous membranes (<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">Han&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>).

TCM also has a treatment plan for patients who have been infected with the disease without symptoms (<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Liu&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><title>Focus on organs other than lungs</title><p id="para0012">Treating patients as an organic whole is the prerequisite for TCM to treat all diseases.

More importantly, TCM also attaches great importance to liver damage caused by COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Chai&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">Liu,&#x000a0;2003</xref>). During the SARS epidemic, it was recognized that the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was activated during the viral infection and subsequently caused a dysfunction in blood clotting. This finding suggested that we should also pay attention to the relationship between the heart and the lungs (<xref rid="bib0064" ref-type="bibr">Xian&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec0005"><title>TCM treatment strategy for COVID-19</title><p id="para0014">TCM divides the disease into four stages according to the law of disease transmission: early stage, advanced stage, critical stage, and recovery stage (<xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>
). In the early stage, the common syndromes of COVID-19 were the syndrome of dampness repressing the defensive qi of the lungs or of wind heat attacking the lungs. The primary treatment is dredging the exterior and penetrating the pathogen, ventilating the lung qi for lowering adverse qi, and treatment against the cold in the Taiyang meridian (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Wang&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">Xiao&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>). In the advanced stage, the common syndromes were the syndrome of dampness blocking the lungs and stomach or pathogenic heat accumulating in the lungs. The main treatment is increasing clear qi and lowering adverse qi (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Shao&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0074" ref-type="bibr">Xue&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>). Then, in the critical stage, the common syndromes were the syndrome of epidemic virus closing the lungs, or internal block and outward desertion. The treatment should allow the Yang to recover and open the orifices to induce resuscitation (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Bai&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">Ma&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">Xiao&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>). Finally, the common syndromes in the recovery stage were the syndromes of qi deficiency of the lungs and spleen.

As early as the 1970s, the study of TCM against the influenza virus has been undertaken in China. There are two ways that TCM acts as an antiviral. The first is by directly inhibiting the virus, primarily by heat clearing and detoxifying. <italic>Lonicera, Folium Isatidis</italic>, and <italic>Scutellaria</italic> are used for inhibition.

With regard to masks, disposable masks were used for medical personnel, and N95 masks were not used (Hao et&#x000a0;al., 2012). In Jingzhou (Hubei province), the worst-hit area of the epidemic, 580 medical staff came from Jingzhou TCM Hospital, and none of them were infected by the disease. In addition, the hospital produces 25,000 preventive Chinese patented medicines for distribution to other hospitals every day (Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2017). In Wuhan, where the epidemic was most severe, Jiangxia Fangcai Hospital also achieved zero infections among medical staff (Seah et&#x000a0;al., 1973). Moreover, in Huanggang, Huangshi (Hubei province), and Guangzhou (Guangdong province), TCM methods were used to prevent the epidemic, and there was zero infection among the medical staff there as well. However, more than 3000 medical staff without TCM prevention were infected. Considering the similarity between the COVID-19 epidemic and the SARS epidemic in 2003, it is pertinent to compare the outcomes among medical personnel in China. Three studies were identified including one controlled study (Lau et&#x000a0;al., 2005) and two single cohort studies (Luo et&#x000a0;al., 2020) conducted during the SARS epidemic. Lau et&#x000a0;al designed a controlled study to evaluate an herbal formula for prevention of SARS (no herbal intervention in the control group) and conducted it in Hong Kong, China. The sample size was 16,437 (1063 in the herbal group and 15,374 in the control group), and all participants were hospital care workers including doctors, nurses, and other staff. The results showed that none of the participants who took a modified formula of Yupingfeng Powder and Sangju Decoction contracted SARS, whereas 64 of 15,347 (0.4%) in the control group were infected with SARS (P=0.035). There were 19 cases (1.8%) of minor adverse effects after 14 days of taking the herbal medicine, including diarrhea, sore throat, dizziness, and nausea. Both single cohort studies were conducted in Beijing, China, with sample sizes of 3561 and 163, respectively. All participants were medical staff from two hospitals in which SARS patients were recruited and treated during the study period (Luo et&#x000a0;al., 2020). One of the studies included only first-line medical staff treating SARS. The courses of taking the herbal formulae for prevention were 6 days and 12 to 25 days for the two cohort studies, respectively. The decoctions used in these studies were both a classic formula of Yupingfeng Powder and some heat-clearing and detoxifying herbs.

According to Guidelines on Acupuncture and Moxibustion Intervention for COVID-19 (second edition) (<xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">Lin&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;2020</xref>), acupuncture and moxibustion intervention was divided into three phases: medical observation phase (suspected cases), clinical treatment phase (confirmed cases), and convalescence phase. In the medical observation phase, the main points were Fengmen (BLl2), Feishu (BLl3), Pishu (BL20), Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Chize (LU5), Yuji (LU10), Qihai (CV6), Zusanli (ST36), and Sanyinjiao (SP6). The purpose was to stimulate the vital qi and the functions of the lungs and spleen, enhancing the viscera's defense. During the clinical treatment phase, the main points chosen were as follows: Hegu (LI4), Taichong (LR3), Tiantu (CV22), Chize (LU5), Kongzui (LU6), Zusanli (ST36), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Dazhu (BLll), Fengmen (BLl2), Feishu (BLl3), Xinshu (BLl5), Geshu (BL17), Zhongfu (LU1), Danzhong (CVl7), Qihai (CV6), Guanyuan (CV4), and Zhongwan (CVl2), in order to stimulate the vital qi of the lungs and spleen, protect the viscera, and dispel pathogens. In the convalescence phase, the main points were Neiguan (PC6), Zusanli (ST36), Zhongwan (CVl2), Tianshu (ST25), and Qihai (CV6).

In cases of fatigue with fever, a combination of Jinhua Qinggan granules, Lianhua Qingwen capsules (granules), and Shufeng Jiedu capsules (granules) are recommended as the Chinese patented medicines with the most effectiveness. In the clinical treatment period, Qingfei Paidu decoction is used for the treatment of mild, regular, and severe patients.
