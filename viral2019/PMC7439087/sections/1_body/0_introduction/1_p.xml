<p id="para0005">Infectious diseases are the demons with which human beings have been fighting since the beginning of human history. Several epidemics have occurred in the history of China. But, fortunately, no large numbers of casualties have occurred, due to the prevalence of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). During the epidemic period of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), TCM played a vital role in fighting the epidemic (

TCM believes that the essence of infectious diseases is not viruses, but “grumpiness.” “Grumpiness” is a kind of evil that appears at the same time as abnormal weather. “Grumpiness” has the characteristics of strong pathogenicity, strong infectivity, entry route to human body through the mouth and nose, and specific lesion location.

SARS-CoV2 can be understood as the “outcry” in Wen Xie, which is of great significance for screening susceptible people.
