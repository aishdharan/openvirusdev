<p id="para0007">The spread of infectious disease among health care workers during an epidemic is another consequence of its widespread distribution. What has become absolutely clear is that the use of isolation clothing, masks, and eye masks is an effective method to prevent the spread. However, this method puts stress on the supply of materials for this equipment. If there is widespread need, and the protective articles are not replaced in a timely way, infection of medical staff may occur. However, none of the medical staff was infected in the TCM hospitals or when using TCM methods (

This gratifying result was confirmed in the prevention and treatment of SARS in 2003 (Luo et al., 2020). Youke Wu, a famous Chinese medicine practitioner in the Qing Dynasty of China, systematically furthered the understanding and treatment of infectious diseases and completed the first monograph on infectious diseases of TCM, entitled “Plague Theory”. In view of the law of transmission of infectious diseases, it is believed that the progress of the disease in the human body can be divided into four steps: defense, qi, nutrient, and blood. These steps can be used to summarize the superficial and deep levels of pathological changes and the severity of these changes. Wei Fen syndrome belongs to the category of exogenous exterior syndrome, which is the initial stage of pathological changes caused by exogenous heat evil invading the human body. Qi Fen syndrome refers to the stage of abnormal qi movement in human viscera or tissues without blood circulation. In Wei Fen and Qi Fen, the disease location is mainly in the lung, stomach, intestine, and gallbladder, and most of these diseases are functional disorders of the human body. Ying Fen syndrome refers to the stage of pathogenic heat in Ying Fen caused by the invasion of pathogenic heat. The stage of main pathological change is burning Ying Yin, which is the third stage of pathological change caused by the invasion of pathogenic factors. Blood Fen syndrome refers to the development of pathogenic heat to blood Fen, resulting in hyperactivity of blood heat. Blood consumption is a stage of major pathological change and the fourth stage in the course of disease. The main pathological change in this stage is organ parenchyma damage. This four-step TCM method of defense, qi, nutrient, and blood explains why no case progressed from mild to severe in the treatment of COVID-19 by TCM (
