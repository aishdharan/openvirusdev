<p id="para0014">TCM divides the disease into four stages according to the law of disease transmission: early stage, advanced stage, critical stage, and recovery stage (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). In the early stage, the common syndromes of COVID-19 were the syndrome of dampness repressing the defensive qi of the lungs or of wind heat attacking the lungs. The primary treatment is dredging the exterior and penetrating the pathogen, ventilating the lung qi for lowering adverse qi, and treatment against the cold in the Taiyang meridian (

 <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). In the advanced stage, the common syndromes were the syndrome of dampness blocking the lungs and stomach or pathogenic heat accumulating in the lungs. The main treatment is increasing clear qi and lowering adverse qi (

 <xref rid="bib0074" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2020</xref>). Then, in the critical stage, the common syndromes were the syndrome of epidemic virus closing the lungs, or internal block and outward desertion. The treatment should allow the Yang to recover and open the orifices to induce resuscitation (

 <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, the common syndromes in the recovery stage were the syndromes of qi deficiency of the lungs and spleen. Attention should be paid to qi and yin in the later period (
