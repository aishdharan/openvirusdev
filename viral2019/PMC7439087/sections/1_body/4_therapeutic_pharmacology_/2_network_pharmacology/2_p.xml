<p id="para0028">The national Health Commission and the State Administration of traditional Chinese medicine jointly issued a notice recommending Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (QFPDT) to be used all over the country (Feng et al., 2019). 
 <xref rid="bib0089" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2020)</xref> explored the mechanism of QFPDT in the treatment of COVID-19 with a network pharmacology analysis, by regulating a series of proteins co-expressed with ACE2 and a series of signaling pathways. QFPDT may act as an antiviral agent by targeting ribosomal proteins that are necessary for viral replication, thus inhibiting viral mRNA translation and inhibiting a group of proteins that interact with viral proteins. 
 <xref rid="bib0072" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2020)</xref> predicted that the first five active ingredients of QFPDT in the treatment of COVID-19 were quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, naringin, and isorrine. QFPDT mainly regulates targets such as MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, MAPK14, IL-6, RELA, and STA T1, and signaling pathways such as TNF and NF-κB to inhibit inflammatory response, regulate immune function, reduce lung injury, and protect nerve function, thus effectively treating COVID-19. Moreover, it was reported that the components with high oral availability of Qingfei oral solution had good molecular docking results with the targets of RdRp, 3Clpro, and PLpr, and could be used to treat viral pneumonia with fever and cough symptoms by regulating multiple signaling pathways (
