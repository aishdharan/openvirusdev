<p id="para0029">Da-Yuan-Yin is the original prescription of QFPDT and provincial anti-COVID-19 prescriptions. Based on network pharmacology and the molecular docking method, 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Zong et al. (2020)</xref> pointed out that the active compounds in Da-Yuan-Yin may regulate multiple signaling pathways by binding ACE2 and acting on targets such as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), heat shock protein 90 alpha family class a member 1 (HSP90AA1), and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) to inhibit COVID-19. On the other hand, as a Chinese patented medicine based on Da-Yuan-Yin, Qingfei Dayuan Granules’ main active ingredients had good binding properties to the receptor according to the molecular docking results (
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>). The series Chinese patented medicines of Huoxiang Zhengqi, including Huoxiang Zhengqi oral liquid, are recommended as preventive drugs for COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal discomfort and fatigue during medical observation. Based on network pharmacology and the molecular docking method, Deng yanjun (
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2020</xref>) suggested that the compounds in Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid can combine with ACE2 binding to PTGS2, heat shock protein 90 alpha family class b member 1 (HSP90AB1), calmodulin regulated spectrin associated protein family member 2 (CAMSAP2), and other targets to regulate multiple signaling pathways, thus exerting a preventive or therapeutic effect on COVID-19. In addition, based on the analysis of network pharmacology, huanglian jiedu soup (
