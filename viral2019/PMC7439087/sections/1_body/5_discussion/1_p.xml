The total rate of relapse of COVID-19 is approximately 0.1% of 8000 cases (Liu et al., 2016). Many hospitals have had no relapse cases to date (Hu et al., 2015). Although pharmacological studies have demonstrated the underlying mechanisms, targets, and biological pathways to treat COVID-19, the only two targets are cathepsin L (CL)-like proteases (CL3) and ACE2. Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) is another host cell route that can be explored for possible pharmacological treatments (Suo et al., 2016).
