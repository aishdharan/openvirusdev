<p id="para0007">Previous systematic reviews have explored social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in HCW during an infectious disease outbreak (

Moreover, the evidence base concerning the effectiveness of the interventions to ameliorate such impact has not been systematically assessed and reported.
