<p id="para0011">We included empirical studies examining the impact on mental health of viral epidemic outbreaks on HCWs, and studies about interventions to reduce such impact. We included observational (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies), and experimental studies (non-controlled before-after studies, controlled before-after studies, non-randomised controlled trials, and randomised controlled trials). We included studies on any type of health emergency caused by a viral epidemic outbreak or pandemic, and examining its impact on HCWs mental health during or after the crisis. For intervention studies, we included also those that examined interventions to protect mental health of HCWs prior, during or after the outbreak onset. All types of settings and healthcare professionals were accepted for inclusion. We included studies measuring any type of mental health problem or psychiatric morbidity. We excluded systematic reviews, narrative reviews, thesis, editorials, protocols, letters to the editor, and studies published in preprint servers but not in peer reviewed journals. We also excluded studies published in languages other than English, Spanish or Portuguese.</p>
