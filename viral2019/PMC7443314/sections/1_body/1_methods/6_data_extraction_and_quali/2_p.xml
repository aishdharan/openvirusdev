<p id="para0013">We used structured forms to extract relevant data, such as country, health emergency, setting, population, epidemiological design, number of participants, mental health conditions, clinical outcomes and their measurement tools, and main study results. For observational studies addressing the impact of health emergencies on HCWs mental health, we extracted the prevalence rate of the mental conditions examined in terms of the number of professionals suffering the condition (numerator) out of the total number of study participants (denominator). If available, we extracted information about the risk factors. For intervention studies (i.e., randomised and non-randomised trials), we extracted data about the characteristics of the intervention as well as that reported also for observational studies.</p>
