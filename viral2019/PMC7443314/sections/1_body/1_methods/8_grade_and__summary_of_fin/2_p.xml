<p id="para0018">We used the GRADE approach (
 <xref rid="bib0062" ref-type="bibr">Schünemann et al., 2019</xref>) to assess the quality of evidence related to the outcomes included in this rapid review. We used GRADEpro 2011 software to create 'Summary of findings' tables. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome, we downgraded the evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious, or by two levels for very serious, study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence, inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates, or potential publication bias (
