<p id="para0021">The results of the risk of bias assessment are provided in Online Appendix 3. In general, main risks of bias in the 106 cross-sectional studies were low response rate (high risk of bias in 10% of the studies) and selection bias (10%). The main sources of bias across the eight cohort studies were related to low confidence that the outcome of interest was not present at start of the study (38%) and to potential selection bias (25%). Main sources of bias of the two uncontrolled before-after studies were bias in selection of participants, and bias in outcome measurement. The case-control study did not present serious risks of bias.</p>
