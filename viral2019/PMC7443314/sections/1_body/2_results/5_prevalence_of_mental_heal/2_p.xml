<p id="para0022">113 studies examined the mental health problems among frontline HCWs during and/or after an viral epidemic outbreak. The individual study characteristics and results are detailed in Online Appendix 4. The great majority of them reported clinically significant mental health symptoms, most frequently PTSD, anxiety, depression, acute stress and burnout. Prevalence forest plots are shown in

For clinically significant symptoms of mental health disorders, the pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress (40%, 95%CI 39 to 41%, I2 0%; 9 studies, 6,949 participants), followed by anxiety (30%, 95%CI 30 to 31%, I2 0%; 32 studies, 43,751 participants), burnout (28%, 95%CI 26 to 31%, 3 studies, 1,168 participants)), depression (24%, 95%CI 24 to 25%, I2 0%; 31 studies, 61,463 participants)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13%, 95%CI 13 to 14%, I2 0%; 16 studies, 24,540 participants)). Subgroup analyses showed higher prevalence of depression (46%, 95%CI 43 to 48%) and of anxiety (30%, 95% 29 to 30%) after the outbreaks than during the outbreaks (24%, 95%CI 24 to 24%, and 30%, 95%CI 29 to 30%, respectively). No relevant differences were observed for the rest of mental health symptoms. According to exploratory subgroup analyses by gender (Online Appendix 5), female HCWs experienced higher prevalence of PTSD (30%, 95%CI 28 to 31%) and anxiety (26%, 95%CI 25 to 27%) than their male counterparts (16%, 95%CI 13 to 14%, and; 21%, 95%CI 19 to 23%, respectively). The prevalence of depression was very similar in male and female HCWs (23% in both cases). No data was available to examine potential gender differences in the prevalence of the rest of burnout and acute stress disorders. Similarly, we could not conduct subgroups analyses to explore differences according to HCWs' age due to the lack of available data reported in a homogeneous format (e.g. age quartiles). Begg's and Egger's tests suggested the absence of publication bias for all the meta-analyses conducted.
