None of them used an experimental design. Two studies in Canada evaluated two educational interventions for improving HCWs mental health by increasing resilience (

 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">Aiello et al., 2011</xref>) conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate an educational intervention targeted to HCWs during the SARS epidemic, which consisted of a face-to-face group training session based on Folkman and Greer's model of coping (
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Folkman and Greer, 2000</xref>). The session focused on stressors associated with pandemic influenza and on organisational and individual approaches to building resilience and reducing stress. While most participants did not feel prepared to deal confidently with the pandemic before the session (35%), there was a higher proportion of participants who felt better able to cope after the session (76%). Maunder and colleagues conducted an uncontrolled before-after study to explore the impact of a computer-assisted resilience training to prepare HCWs for a potential pandemic influenza (
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Maunder et al., 2010</xref>). The course consisted of modules incorporating different modalities of learning (knowledge-based modules, relaxation skills, and self-assessment modules using questionnaires to characterize interpersonal problems and coping style). The intervention improved confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems (p&lt;0.05). One cross-sectional study examined the impact of exercise interventions to relieve psychological stress and improve sleep status for frontline medical staff in the fight against COVID-19 in China (
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Wei, 2020</xref>). In comparison with the control group, participants in the intervention group experienced higher levels of anxiety (45.89±1.12 vs 41.02±1.15; p=0.056), depression (50.13±1.81 vs 36.11±2.06; p=0.04), and PTSD (50.13±1.813 vs 29.89 ±1.97; p=0.03). We have very low confidence on the evidence of educational interventions for preventing the psychological impact of viral epidemic outbreaks in HCWs due to the study design (uncontrolled before-after studies) and very serious risk of bias regarding confounding and measurement of outcomes (Online Appendix 7).
