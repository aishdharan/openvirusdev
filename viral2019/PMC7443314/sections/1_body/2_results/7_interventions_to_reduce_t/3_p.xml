 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) evaluated the effects of a multifaceted intervention to prevent depression and anxiety in hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic. The intervention included in-service training, manpower allocation, gathering sufficient protective equipment, and establishment of a mental health team. The authors observed statistically significant improvements in nurses' anxiety and depression along with sleep quality at two weeks follow-up. Our confidence on the evidence for multifaceted interventions for preventing the psychological impact during viral epidemic outbreaks in HCWs was very low (Online Appendix 7) due to limitations in the study design (uncontrolled before after studies) and very serious risk of bias (high risk of selection bias and high risk of bias in measurement of outcomes).
