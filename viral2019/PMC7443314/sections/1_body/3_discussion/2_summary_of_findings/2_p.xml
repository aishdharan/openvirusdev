<p id="para0031">In this timely systematic rapid review, we synthesized evidence from 117 studies examining the impact on mental health of providing frontline healthcare during viral epidemic outbreaks. Results showed that HCWs commonly present high levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, both during and after the outbreaks. We identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic factors such as younger age and female gender, and social factors such as lack of social support, social rejection or isolation and stigmatization. Occupational factors entailed working in a high-risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and having lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. In contrast with the high number of studies examining impact on mental health, there is limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to reduce mental health problems in this particularly vulnerable population, and overall its certainty is very low, mainly due to study design and serious risk of bias.</p>
