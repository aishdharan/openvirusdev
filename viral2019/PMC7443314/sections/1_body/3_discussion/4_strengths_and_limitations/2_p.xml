<p id="para0036">This is a timely and comprehensive rapid review of the current literature on the impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on the mental health of HCWs. We examined three relevant areas, namely the prevalence of mental health problems, factors associated with an increased likelihood of developing those problems, and the effects of interventions to improve mental health of HCWs.

There were also some limitations underlying this work. Despite searching three major databases and manually searching references of previously published systematic reviews, we did not examine grey literature. Moreover, the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. Therefore, we cannot discard that relevant references may have been missed out.
