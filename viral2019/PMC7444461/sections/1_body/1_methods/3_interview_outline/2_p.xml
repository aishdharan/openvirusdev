<p id="para0016">Relevant literature and expert opinions were used to design interview questions. Two patients were pre-interviewed to determine the outline of the interview. The main interview questions were as follows: (1) How did you feel during hospitalization as a patient with COVID-19? (2) What was your main form of stress during hospitalization? (3) How did the illness affect you? How did you respond? (4) What did you feel or think about this illness? (5) Are there any other ideas you would like to express?</p>
