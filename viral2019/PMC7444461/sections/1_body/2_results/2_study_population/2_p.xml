<p id="para0019">The study cohort included 9 male and 7 female COVID-19 patients, aged 24-65 years. The majority of patients were married and educated to a high level. Six patients (6/16; 37.50%) had chronic diseases. Among them, hypertension was found in two cases and there was one case each of diabetes, chronic gastritis, hyperlipidemia, and coronary heart disease. COVID-19-related complications accounted for 25.00% (4\16) of all cases. These comprised one case each with liver damage, allergic dermatitis, liver damage combined with dermatitis, and atelectasis. A total of 14 cases were non-life-threatening (87.50%) and 2 were deemed critical (12.50%). Hospital stays ranged between 10 and28 days; interviews were conducted on average 3-5 times, including 1-2 face-to-face interviews and 2-4 telephone interviews. The interview interval was determined according to the patient's condition and willingness, with the shortest being one day and the longest seven days (
