<p id="para0056">Patients with COVID-19 are in a state of physical and mental stress. Under quarantine, their attitudes towards the disease gradually transformed and their emotional responses altered according to the stage of treatment. The negative emotions of patients during the early stage gradually became a mix of both positive and negative emotions. Timely psychological interventions can prevent physical and mental harm and promote the positive transformation of attitudes and emotions. Chinese culture may affect positive factors such as epidemic prevention, psychological adjustment, and sufficient social support. The majority of patients gradually practiced self-growth brought about by the disease and actively guided this growth to promote both short- and long-term physical and mental recovery.</p>
