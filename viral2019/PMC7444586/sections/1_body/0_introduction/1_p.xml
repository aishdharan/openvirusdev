<p>The current geographic spread of the documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] infections and associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] shows heterogeneity [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This remains unexplained but may possibly reflect delays in virus introduction into the population, differentials in testing and/or reporting, differentials in the implementation, scale, adherence, and timing of public health interventions, or other epidemiological factors. In this study, we explore the role of age in explaining the differential spread of the infection and its future epidemic potential.
