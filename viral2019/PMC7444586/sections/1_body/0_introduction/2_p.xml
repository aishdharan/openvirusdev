<p>As our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is rapidly evolving [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the role of age in the epidemiology of this infection is becoming increasingly apparent [

 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In a recent study examining SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in China [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], we quantified the effect of age on the 
 <italic>biological</italic> susceptibility to infection acquisition. We found that 
 <italic>relative</italic> to individuals aged 60–69 years, susceptibility was 0.06 in those aged 0–19 years, 0.34 in those aged 20–29 years, 0.57 in those aged 30–39 years, 0.69 in those aged 40–49 years, 0.79 in those aged 50–59 years, 0.94 in those aged 70–79 years, and 0.88 in those aged ≥80 years (S1 Fig in
