<p>We adapted and applied our recently developed deterministic mathematical model [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237959.s001">S1 File</xref>), to 159 countries and territories, virtually covering the world population [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since our focus was on investigating the natural course of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and on assessing its full epidemic potential, the model was applied assuming the
