<p>Model parameters were based on current data for SARS-CoV-2 natural history and epidemiology, or through model fitting to the China outbreak data [

 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Whenever available data for a parameter covered a wider age bracket, we assumed that this parameter has the same value for all age groups within that bracket. Model parameters, definitions, values, and justifications are in Section B and S1, S2 Tables in
