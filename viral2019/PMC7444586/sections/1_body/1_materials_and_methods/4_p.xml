<p>Ranges of uncertainty around model-predicted outcomes were determined using five-hundred simulation runs that applied Latin Hypercube sampling [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] from a multidimensional distribution of the model parameters, including both the natural history parameters and the age-specific susceptibility profile. At each run, input parameter values were selected from ranges specified by assuming ±30% uncertainty around parameters’ point estimates [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The resulting distribution for each model-predicted outcome was then used to derive the most probable estimate (based on maximum likelihood) and 95% uncertainty interval. Mathematical modelling analyses were performed in MATLAB R2019a [
