<p>Our study may have overestimated disease mortality by basing mortality rates on estimates of the crude case fatality rate in China, as suggested by a recent study [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our results are based on the most probable value for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> as estimated through 500 runs of uncertainty analysis. The latter may have biased our reported results towards lower 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. For instance, the most probable value for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> in China was 1.95, but the point estimate assuming the baseline values of the input parameters was higher at 2.10 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite these limitations, our parsimonious model, tailored to the nature of available data, was able to reproduce the epidemic as observed in China [
