<p>The above results suggest that although this pandemic is a formidable challenge globally, its intensity and toll in terms of morbidity and mortality may vary substantially by country and regionally. While some countries, particularly in resource-rich countries, may experience large and rapid epidemics, other countries, particularly in resource-poor countries, may experience smaller and slower epidemics. While the scale of the epidemic may be smallest in sub-Saharan Africa with its young population, it could be intense in countries with a relatively small proportion of children and sizable proportions of adults and/or elderly.</p>
