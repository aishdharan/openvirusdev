<p>The key finding of this study is the potential role of age in driving divergent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories and disease burdens. The effect of age reflects the interplay of three main factors: the variation in susceptibility by age (S1 Fig in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237959.s001">S1 File</xref>), variation in disease severity and mortality by age (S2 Fig in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237959.s001">S1 File</xref>), and variation in demographic structure across countries (S3-S8 Tables in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237959.s001">S1 File</xref>). The combined effect of these factors can result in stark variations in

 <sub>0</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237959.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and consequently epidemic potential, disease severity, and disease mortality—there was strong correlation between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and median age across countries (S4 Fig in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237959.s001">S1 File</xref>). Incidentally, the globally diagnosed cases as of July 16, 2020 show a significant correlation with median age across countries (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.19–0.47), p&lt;0.001). Although this may be explained by more diagnosed infections being reported by countries with advanced testing infrastructure, this may support the role of age presented here. Importantly, as infection transmission dynamics is a non-linear phenomenon, even small changes in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, when 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is in the range of 1–2, can drive considerable differences in epidemic size and trajectory. Variability by age, though of different magnitude, was also noted in a recent other research work [
