<p>An illustration of the role of age can be seen in Niger, a nation with a median age of only 15 years, where the exclusion of children from the population, while maintaining the same susceptibility profile for the other age groups, would have increased

This demonstrates how the lower susceptibility among younger persons, particularly children, acts as a “herd immunity” impeding the ferocious strength of the force of infection of an otherwise very infectious virus. This epidemiological feature contrasts that of other respiratory infections, such as the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic (H1N1pdm) infection (S5 Fig in
