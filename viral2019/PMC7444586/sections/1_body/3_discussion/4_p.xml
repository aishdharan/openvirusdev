<p>One possible inference to be drawn from the above results is that epidemic size and associated disease burden could be highest in settings with sizable mid-age and/or elderly populations, as currently exemplified by Italy. This may also possibly explain sub-national patterns, such as the large number of diagnosed cases in the city of New York, although additional fine-grained analyses are needed to delineate within-country heterogeneities in transmission dynamics.</p>
