<p>Another possible inference of relevance to containment efforts relates to the likelihood of the infection establishing itself in a population. In addition to the role of travel patterns/restrictions and multiple introductions for seeding the infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Accordingly, in countries where

 <sub>0</sub> is just above the epidemic threshold of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 1, the virus will need to be introduced multiple times before it can generate sustainable chains of transmission. In such countries, less disruptive social distancing measures may be sufficient to contain the epidemic compared to countries with larger
