<p>This study has limitations. Model estimations are contingent on the validity and generalizability of input data. Our estimates were based on SARS-CoV-2 natural history and disease progression data from China, but these may not be applicable to other countries. The key factor driving the heterogeneity in transmission dynamics is the age-specific biological susceptibility profile. We used the susceptibility profile as derived from the China outbreak data [

More estimates from other countries are needed to investigate the potential variation in this profile across countries, and different analytical approaches may also arrive at different estimates [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Some of the effects of biological susceptibility may simply reflect differences in social behavior or the probability of infection ascertainment. The presence and contribution of such factors are, however, difficult to disentangle.
