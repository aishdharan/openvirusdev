<p>Increasingly, evidence suggests that

 <sub>0</sub> is higher than assumed here based on fitting the China epidemic [

 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which would increase the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values reported here, but will not affect the relative differences across countries. We assumed a constant overall contact rate across countries, but contact rate patterns, and therefore 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, can vary across and within countries [

 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and also over time with the implementation of interventions and associated behavioral changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. There could be also transient effects affecting transmission patterns and epidemic dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We assumed low degree of assortativeness in age group mixing based on fitting the China epidemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], however, a sensitivity analysis assuming high assortativeness, though yielded higher estimates for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, still preserved the relative differences in these estimates across countries (S10 Fig in
