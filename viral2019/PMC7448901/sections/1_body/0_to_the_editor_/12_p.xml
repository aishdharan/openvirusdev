<p>Most early-stage cases were from the UK, EU, and USA, indicating an increase in asymptomatic or mild cases in these countries. Our data support that the incoming international epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 originated from covert coronavirus infections [

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, the clinical course and hospitalisation time of patients with COVID-19 were much longer than those of influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported a median duration of viral shedding of 20 days (IQR 17–24), indicating that hospitalised isolation of all patients during an outbreak is not possible. Temporary medical care points such as “Fangcang hospital” or “community isolation point” should be used for these cases [
