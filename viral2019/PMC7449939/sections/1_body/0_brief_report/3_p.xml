<p id="para0008">When Singapore raised the DORSCON alert to orange, SGH mandated cancellation of elective and non-urgent procedures/surgeries to ring-fence more beds for dedicated respiratory and pneumonia wards in preparation for a larger-scale outbreak. Negative pressure rooms at SGH are used solely for cases and suspected cases of COVID-19. Operationally, face-to-face meetings were discouraged within SGH, and the workforce was generally divided into small teams (e.g. five to 10 members per team) as part of the hospital's business contingency plan. Accordingly, the ASP team was divided into two pharmacy teams so that the ASP would still be operationally functional with one team if the other team had to be quarantined. Instead of face-to-face meetings, daily ASP meetings with the ID physician were conducted via teleconferencing.</p>
