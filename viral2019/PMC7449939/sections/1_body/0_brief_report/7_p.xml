<p id="para0012">This epidemic has placed enormous strain on healthcare providers and healthcare systems worldwide. Singapore has placed a high emphasis on identifying and isolating patients with COVID-19 in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. In the early weeks of the containment strategy, patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of viral illness were actively screened and isolated until results returned negative for COVID-19. Consequently, the authors believe that there were more admissions of patients with acute respiratory illness which would otherwise have been treated in the community prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients were usually started empirically on antibiotics used for the treatment of community-onset pneumonia, coinciding with the increased utilization of these agents. Furthermore, the authorsâ€™ initial hypothesis that the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics should decrease together with the number of admissions was debunked. Instead, prescription numbers for these agents were observed to increase as they target serious, nosocomial infections which are often associated with urgent conditions (e.g. cancer, for which treatment cannot be delayed). Hence, in a tertiary healthcare institution such as SGH, the impact of COVID-19, as well as the continued care for hospitalized patients with complex medical issues, culminated in a higher proportion of patients on antibiotics compared with the pre-COVID period. It would be prudent to maintain the ASP even in viral epidemics/pandemics with existing manpower support
