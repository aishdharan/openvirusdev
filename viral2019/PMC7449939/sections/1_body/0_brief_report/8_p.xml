<p id="para0013">At the start of the pandemic, the authors received support from hospital management to maintain the ASP as an essential service – a commitment towards the continued fight against antimicrobial resistance. The importance for ASPs to be operationally adaptable to different scenarios also became evident. Organizational restructuring and migration to telecommuting platforms for the ASP activities was crucial to maintain clinical service while observing distancing measures, thus ensuring patient and staff safety in this pandemic. It also became apparent that in addition to focusing efforts on nosocomial treatments, this was an opportunity for the authors’ team to execute a syndromic approach towards guiding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections. To do so, there is a need to employ digital platforms, and to continue to develop robust surveillance systems that are able to detect subtle changes in prescribing and resistance trends. In outbreak situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on-going engagement and education of prescribers to mitigate antibiotic misuse that tends to occur with viral epidemics/pandemics is extremely important to avoid undoing years of progress in antibiotic stewardship.</p>
