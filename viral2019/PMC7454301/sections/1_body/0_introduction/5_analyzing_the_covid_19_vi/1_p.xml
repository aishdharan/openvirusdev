 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] studied the characteristics of the COVID-19 receptor-binding domain (RBD) by implication for the development of RBD protein as a viral attachment inhibitor and vaccine. Zhou 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed that COVID-19 belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV and also uses the same cell entry receptor that is called angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Pradhan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] concentrated light on the development and pathogenicity of the COVID-19 virus with important implications for its diagnosis. Cao 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] introduced a comparative genetic analysis of the COVID-19 receptor ACE2 in various populations.
