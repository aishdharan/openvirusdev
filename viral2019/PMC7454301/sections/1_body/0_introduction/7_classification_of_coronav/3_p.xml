<p>In this paper, the three most common coronaviruses faced by humanity, in the last two decades, are studied. They are COVID-19, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that have made a big argument worldwide and have become dangerous epidemics that resulted in many death cases. This research treated them as genetic diseases, and it proposed a system with high-accuracy results that can detect the type of disease using its genome which leads to a rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 avoiding the disadvantages of the previous traditional diagnostic methods. The proposed system depends on employing the genomic signal processing (GSP) and the classification algorithms, as explained in the next section.</p>
