<p>In this step, moment invariants are used as features for the classification. They are first introduced by Hu in [
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; next of that different researches applied them as in [
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41â€“44</xref>]. The seven moment invariants are defined as six absolute orthogonal invariants and one skew orthogonal invariant. These invariants are constructed using the generalized fundamental theorem of moment invariants (GFTMI) [
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
