<p>The K-nearest algorithm is a learning method based on states, so it doesn’t want a learning stage. It treats with the training pattern that is related to a distance function and the choice of the class function based on the classes of the nearest neighbors [
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. When a new pattern is classified, it must be compared to others using a similarity measure taking into consideration the 
 <italic>k</italic>-neighbors. The distance between the new pattern and the neighbor is used as the weight [
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47–49</xref>]. The most prevalent method to measure this distance is Euclidean. To measure the Euclidean distance between two vectors p
 <sub>i</sub> and p
 <sub>j</sub>, the equation mentioned in [
 <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] will be used:
