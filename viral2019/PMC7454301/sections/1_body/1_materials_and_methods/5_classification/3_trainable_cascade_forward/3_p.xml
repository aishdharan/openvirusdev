<p>For the classification process, the training data consists of 46 complete genomes, and the testing data consists of 30 complete genomes for each epidemic. In this step, three classification processes are done for every classifier: firstly, creating a system to distinguish between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV epidemics; secondly, generating a system to set apart between COVID-19 and MERS-CoV; thirdly, building a complete system to differentiate between the three pandemics; and finally, comparing the output results from the two used classifiers for all processes.</p>
