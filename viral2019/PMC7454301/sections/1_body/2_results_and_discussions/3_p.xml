<p>In the comparison case, getting higher ACC, lower error rate, higher F1 score and higher MCC is an evidence that the classification process is more successful and the used classifier is more efficient. These resulting parameters indicate that the classifier can recognize the required target with minimum errors. From the research results, the KNN classifier can achieve these conditions and reach the research purpose to differentiate between the COVID-19, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics using the genomic signal processing methods. The proposed system provides a new scope for coronaviruses researches as results illustrate the success of using the GSP methods for the epidemicsâ€™ recognition and diagnosis. 
 <xref rid="TB4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> provides a simple comparison of results obtained in the proposed work to other existing studies in terms of the used database, extracted features, used classifier and results.
