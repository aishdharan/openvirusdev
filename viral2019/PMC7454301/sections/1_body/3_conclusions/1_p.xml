<p>After spreading of COVID-19 epidemic, many researchers all over the world have started medically to study, analyze and plan, hoping to reach medicine for this terrifying disease quickly. As a result, some researchers began to compare the COVID-19 with the other coronaviruses in terms of the origin, symptoms, envelope spike S protein characteristics, infection, CT images shape, etc. Besides, there are many tests like RT-PCR and RRT-PCR that can diagnose the COVID-19 cases but with some drawbacks such as the lack of test kits, need for suction tools, high cost, long period of time to get results and patient pain. Considering the coronaviruses are genetic diseases, using genomic signal processing techniques and choosing suitable classifiers are the basic outlines for the proposed work. This work introduces an automated system for detecting COVID-19 and how to distinguish it from the other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This system can assist in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 with highly acceptable accuracy results as it does not depend on the previously mentioned classical diagnostic methodsâ€™ disadvantages. It is executed simply by separating DNA sequences using the DNA centrifuge [

All the results are acceptable and satisfying, but the KNN results are perfect for the created classification system getting the best and most efficient diagnosis method. In the future work, either other features will be used or different classifiers will be selected to achieve new objectives in COVID-19 researches.
