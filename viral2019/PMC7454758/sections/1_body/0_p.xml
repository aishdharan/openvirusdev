Those 11 patients had at least 1 negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-Cov-2 before flight boarding. A total of six were women and five men with age ranging from 42 to 76 (median of 70). All were transferred in a dedicated bus directly from the ship to the aircraft. The equipment was a charter Bombardier Galaxy 6000 commercial aircraft. Flight staff included three pilots and one steward, who were instructed to wear filtering facepiece (FFP2) masks.
