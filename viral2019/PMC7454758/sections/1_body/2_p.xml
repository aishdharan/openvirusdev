<p>Our information of this long-haul flight may support claims of low risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 during flights. Although our example may underestimate the risk of transmission due to the use, by some of the passengers, of higher standard masks (N95). Yet, the very close proximity and contact for a long duration and at least for some part of the flight uncovered their face, may further suggest that the observations of low risk of SARS transmission holds true for COVID-19. Since experimentations aircraft viral transmission may be complicated and not applicable to all types of equipment, the WHO recommendations for SARS may be used for air travel on situations where COVID-19 patients are present with the modification of using masks.</p>
