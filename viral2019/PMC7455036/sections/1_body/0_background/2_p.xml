<p>The present study was carried out in an early stage of the epidemic in China and was meant to measure the effectiveness of these two measures through a modified SIR model and to make predictions about the first wave of the epidemic in China. First, we validated the accuracy of the model using real-world data from Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces in China. Second, we used the validated model to evaluate the effectiveness of the two measures. Our model predicted that the first wave of the epidemic would come under control in early June, which closely approximates real-world data.</p>
