<p>Based on data from Wuhan from December 18, 2019 to December 22, 2019, we found 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.20. Since 
 <italic>β</italic> = 
 <italic>λ</italic>×
 <italic>p</italic>, we found 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.040 and R
 <sub>0</sub> = 2.805. This value of 
 <italic>p</italic> was determined from real-world Hubei data, so we did not calculate a 95% confidence interval for it.
