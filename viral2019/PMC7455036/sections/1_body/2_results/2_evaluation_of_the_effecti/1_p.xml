<p>We calculated 
 <italic>α</italic> values for Wuhan city and China excluding Hubei (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238411.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and found that the 
 <italic>α</italic> value of Wuhan decreased slightly after city lockdown (from 0.869 on January 23 to 0.228 on February 16). However, the 
 <italic>α</italic> value of China excluding Hubei decreased steadily after January 23 (from 5.563 on January 23 to 0.064 on February 16). These results suggest that the rapid spread of the virus from Wuhan to other cities was effectively suppressed, but not the local spread in Wuhan.
