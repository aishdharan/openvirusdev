<p>The nationwide intensive community screening (starting on February 16) was associated with a significant decrease in the α value of Wuhan city (from 0.228 on February 16 to 0.003 on March 10) and a stable α value of China excluding Hubei (from 0.064 on February 16 to 0.079 on March 10). This suggests that intensive community screening significantly enhanced the effectiveness of Wuhan city isolation and kept infection levels stable in other regions. As a result, the infected cases decreased significantly in Wuhan and China excluding Hubei, from 36385 and 8163 on February 16, respectively, to 13462 and 493 on March 11 (
