<p>The α values from March 11 to May 26 were obtained by fitting the α values from January 23 to March 10. We also used the higher 
 <italic>φ</italic> values in the late phase of epidemic to predict 
 <italic>φ</italic> values from March 11 to May 27. Taking the initial 
 <italic>i</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), 
 <italic>s</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), and 
 <italic>r</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) as the values on March 10, we predicted the number of patients on a given day 
 <italic>i</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) from March 12 to May 27. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238411.g005">Fig 5</xref>). We collected data on the actual number of patients in China up to May 27, and plotted the curve to compare with the predicted results for the same time period. The predicted trend showed only slight deviation from the real-world trend (
