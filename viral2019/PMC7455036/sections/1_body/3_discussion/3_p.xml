<p>Next the modified SIR model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of city lockdown and intensive community screening. The predicted numbers of infections without those mitigation measures were much higher than the real numbers of infections in Wuhan and China excluding Hubei, suggesting that the two mitigation measures were effective in suppressing the spread of the epidemic. A step-wise reduced 
 <italic>α</italic> value may reflect effective isolation of infected individuals. Specifically, Wuhan city lockdown largely decreased the 
 <italic>α</italic> value of China excluding Hubei by containing a large proportion of infected individuals in Wuhan city. Hospital beds were in extremely short supply at the beginning of the epidemic, which meant that a large proportion of infected individuals returned to the community, where they could transmit the virus to family members and neighbors. Intensive community screening, in turn, significantly decreased the 
 <italic>α</italic> value locally in Wuhan city and kept it at a low level. This is probably because when screened individuals tested positive, they were notified and advised to self-quarantine at home or, if they lived with several others, to self-quarantine in newly built medical centers or quarantine facilities. At the same time, people living in close contact with the positive individual were also advised to self-quarantine. These steps appear to have been effective at reducing the 
 <italic>α</italic> value.
