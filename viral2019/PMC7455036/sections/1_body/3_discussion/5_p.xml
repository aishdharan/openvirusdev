<p>Our study has limitations. First, this modified SIR model predicts the 
 <italic>α</italic> values based on the current trend. If major disturbances occur in the future, such as critical virus mutation or new measures from the government, the existing model may be less accurate. Second, the two measures of city lockdown and nationwide community screening may not be suitable for every country. Some countries advocate allowing the development of herd immunity without stringent mitigations. However, this approach may be inappropriate for countries as populous as China. Many countries may not be able to achieve stringent city lockdowns or intensive community screening due to concerns over violating personal privacy and human rights. Nevertheless, it may be possible to use “softer” approaches to achieve social distancing and rapid isolation of potentially infected individuals, such as educating the public about the seriousness of COVID-19 and asking individuals with suspected symptoms to strictly self-quarantine.
