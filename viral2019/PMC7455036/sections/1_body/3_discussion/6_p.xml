<p>Despite these limitations, our study presents a reliable modified SIR model to predict the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. Based on this model, city lockdown is effective at blocking the spread from the epidemic area into other cities, while intensive community screening may cut off infected individuals from susceptible individuals. These two measures greatly improve social distancing. Global efforts are needed to halt the pandemic. Here we shared our experiences with implementing social distancing at the national level. Other countries should tailor their social distancing strategies to their local situation.</p>
