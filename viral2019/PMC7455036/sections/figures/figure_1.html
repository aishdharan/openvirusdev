The φ values from February 3 to February 12 (before nationwide intensive community screening but after Wuhan city lockdown) were used to predict φ values from February 13 to March 11 for Guangdong (A) and Zhejiang (D). The α values from February 8 to February 12 (before nationwide intensive community screening but after Wuhan city lockdown) were used to predict α values from February 13 to March 10 for Guangdong (B) and Zhejiang (E).
