   <italic>φ</italic> values from January 23 to February 15 without city lockdown. (B) The 
   <italic>α</italic> values for Wuhan city at January 22 (before city lockdown) were used to predict the 
   <italic>α</italic> values from January 23 to February 14 without city lockdown. (C) Predicted 
   <italic>α</italic> values and 
   <italic>φ</italic> values were used to calculate the number of infections in Wuhan city from January 24 to February 15. (D) The 
   <italic>φ</italic> values for China excluding Hubei province on January 22 were used to predict the 
   <italic>φ</italic> values from January 23 to February 15 without city lockdown. (E) The 
   <italic>α</italic> values for China excluding Hubei province on January 22 were used to predict the 
   <italic>α</italic> values from January 23 to February 14 without city lockdown. (F) Predicted 
   <italic>α</italic> values and 
   <italic>φ</italic> values were used to calculate the numbers of infections in China excluding Hubei province from January 24 to February 15.
