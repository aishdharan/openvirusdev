 <caption> Impact of intensive community screening on Wuhan city and China excluding Hubei province. (A) The φ values from February 11 to February 15 (before intensive community screening) were fitted to predict the φ values for Wuhan city from February 16 to March 11 without intensive community screening. (B) The α values from February 6 to February 15 (before intensive community screening) were fitted to predict the α values for Wuhan city from February 16 to March 10 without intensive community screening. (C) The predicted α values and φ values were used to calculate the numbers of infections in Wuhan city from February 16 to March 11. (D) The φ values from February 11 to February 15 (before intensive community screening) were fitted to predict the φ values for China excluding Hubei Province from February 16 to March 11 without intensive community screening. (E) The α values for China excluding Hubei Province from February 6 to February 15 were used to predict the α values for China excluding Hubei Province from February 16 to March 10 without intensive community screening. (F) The predicted α values and φ values were used to calculate the numbers of infections in China excluding Hubei Province from February 16 to March 11. </caption>
