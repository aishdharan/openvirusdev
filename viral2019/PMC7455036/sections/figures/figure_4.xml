  <title>Impact of intensive community screening on Wuhan city and China excluding Hubei province.</title>
  <p>(A) The 
   <italic>φ</italic> values from February 11 to February 15 (before intensive community screening) were fitted to predict the 
   <italic>φ</italic> values for Wuhan city from February 16 to March 11 without intensive community screening. (B) The 
   <italic>α</italic> values from February 6 to February 15 (before intensive community screening) were fitted to predict the 
   <italic>α</italic> values for Wuhan city from February 16 to March 10 without intensive community screening. (C) The predicted 
   <italic>α</italic> values and 
   <italic>φ</italic> values were used to calculate the numbers of infections in Wuhan city from February 16 to March 11. (D) The 
   <italic>φ</italic> values from February 11 to February 15 (before intensive community screening) were fitted to predict the 
   <italic>φ</italic> values for China excluding Hubei Province from February 16 to March 11 without intensive community screening. (E) The 
   <italic>α</italic> values for China excluding Hubei Province from February 6 to February 15 were used to predict the 
   <italic>α</italic> values for China excluding Hubei Province from February 16 to March 10 without intensive community screening. (F) The predicted 
   <italic>α</italic> values and 
   <italic>φ</italic> values were used to calculate the numbers of infections in China excluding Hubei Province from February 16 to March 11.
