<p>Dengue had a low incidence and was not considered a public health problem in Guatemala during most of the twentieth century, possibly as a by-product of the national malaria and yellow fever eradication campaigns [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However dengue viruses were reported since at least 1978, and all four serotypes had been reported by the 1990s [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with a major outbreak of DENV3 with over 300,000 cases occurring in 1995 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Systematic descriptions of the incidence of all serotypes in recent decades, however, are missing despite increasing number of cases reported by health services. We have thus undertaken an analysis of 17-years of dengue surveillance data in Guatemala, to describe longitudinal trends from 2000 to 2016, and the emergence and overlap of DENV serotypes in the country.
