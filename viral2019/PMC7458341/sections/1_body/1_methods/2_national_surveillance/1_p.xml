<p>Surveillance of arboviral infections in Guatemala is conducted by the National Epidemiology Centre and the National Public Health Laboratories (Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia and Laboratorio Nacional de Salud, LNS) of the Ministry of Health. The surveillance network comprises 340 primary care centres and 44 hospitals situated in the 29 health areas of the country. Surveillance is based on the regular reporting of data by the health facilities and is mostly passive, with some time-limited active surveillance during outbreaks. Health facilities submit serum samples to the LNS for laboratory confirmation of clinical cases, with samples sent in ice boxes via road transport. Test requests include patient information such as gender, age, address, history of travel, hospitalization, date of illness onset, and symptoms. The LNS test all samples received during endemic months, but only a proportion of samples during epidemic periods, when the laboratory prioritises severe and hospitalised cases. The laboratory has the capacity to test for dengue, chikungunya and Zika infections, with the aim of testing samples for all three viruses, except during outbreaks, when the most likely causative infection is prioritised. The LNS reports surveillance data to the National Epidemiology Centre, which in turn advises the Ministry of Health. Reports of new outbreaks, new arboviruses, and serious cases are in turn reported to the Pan American Health Organisation, along with monthly reports of passive surveillance data.</p>
