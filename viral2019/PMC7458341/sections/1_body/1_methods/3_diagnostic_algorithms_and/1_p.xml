<p>Dengue case definitions have changed with the advent of new diagnostics and updates of international case definitions. Between 2000 and 2010, testing for DENV was based on culture in clone C6/36 cells of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, with confirmation based on immunofluorescent staining and fluorescence microscopy. In 2009 the LNS introduced the NS1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to detect DENV antigens in serum, and since 2010 testing of acute cases has utilised the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) DENV 1–4 RT-qPCR assay that serotypes the virus with a limit of detection of between 5–10 copies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the CDC 1–4 RT-qPCR continues to be used to confirm and serotype all Trioplex-positive samples, as this test had not been validated at the time of its introduction. Samples in the surveillance database with positive results to any of these tests are recorded as “confirmed dengue case”. Since 2000, samples from patients with symptoms over 5 days have also been tested with IgM antibody capture ELISA (MAC
 <bold>-</bold>ELISA) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and samples positive solely by this assay are reported here as “probable cases”.
