<p>A total of 91,554 samples were received by the LNS from 2000 to 2016. The number of samples received varied over the years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008535.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Dengue infection was confirmed by RT-qPCR, viral culture or NS1 ELISA in 7097 (7.8%) samples and a further 19,290 (21.1%) were positive by IgM ELISA (probable cases). Samples were more likely to be confirmed after the introduction of RT-qPCR in 2009. The number of probable cases was higher between 2005 and 2007 and 2012â€“2014, which were years preceded by periods of high dengue incidence (
