However, during outbreaks the proportion of cases occurring among 5–20 and 20–60 age groups (2005, 2007 and 2013 DENV1, 2010 DENV2 and 2003 DENV3) was higher than in the following years, when the incidence was similar across all age groups (

Although some years affected higher proportions of men or women, there was no significant association with epidemics years or the predominance of a dengue serotype (
