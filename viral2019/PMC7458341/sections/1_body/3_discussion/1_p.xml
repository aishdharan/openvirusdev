<p>Central America has a considerable burden of dengue, with an estimated incidence of 169 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared with 33.8 in the Caribbean, and 586.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in South America [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Dengue is hyperendemic, and seasonal in Guatemala with simultaneous circulation of all DENV serotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In Guatemala, most infections were caused by DENV1 and DENV2, followed by DENV3 and DENV4, which mirrors reports from other Pan American Health Organization regions. The co-circulation of all four DENV serotypes increases the risk of second infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with a different serotype, which leads to a higher risk of severe dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Whilst previous DENV exposure can lead to the development of severe symptoms with the second infection; there is also some evidence of serological cross protection over the ensuing one to three years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which potentially may account for the reduction in the number of cases after epidemic years.
