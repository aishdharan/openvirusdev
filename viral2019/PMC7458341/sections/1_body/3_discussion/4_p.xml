<p>The large 2010 DENV2 epidemic in Guatemala coincided with simultaneous DENV2 outbreaks across other Central and South American countries, with over 1.6 million reported cases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is thought to reflect herd immunity afforded by previous infection with the same serotype. Although it is widely believed that infection by a serotype confers lifelong immunity thanks to the development of serotype specific heterologous neutralising antibodies, recent studies describing homotypic re-infections in the short and long term have challenged this concept [
