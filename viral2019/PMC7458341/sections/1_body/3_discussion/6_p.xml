<p>Passive surveillance is the standard approach used for dengue surveillance worldwide. This is due, in part, to the cost of implementing active case detection strategies for a disease with no specific treatment and limited vaccine uptake. Passive surveillance for dengue in Latin America has underestimated the number of cases by a factor between 3.5 and 19 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and as a result, the number of cases presented here is likely to underestimate the real burden of dengue in Guatemala. This underreporting can lead to the underappreciation of the impact of dengue in a region, leading to insufficient public health efforts to control transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The reliance on passive surveillance can also result in an over-representation of severe cases that require the clinic and hospital services, adding bias to epidemiological data, particularly regarding disease severity and patient outcomes. It has been estimated that ambulatory patients, who make up the majority of cases in Latin America, incur the biggest economic cost [

Whilst most costs to hospitalised patients are direct healthcare costs, the effect of dengue on non-hospitalised patients incurs a large socio-economic costs, mainly due to reduced productivity [
