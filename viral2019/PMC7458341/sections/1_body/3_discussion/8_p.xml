<p>A limitation of the geographical analysis presented here is that the selection of sentinel sites and reporting centres reflects prior knowledge of areas considered to be endemic. Therefore, our analysis represents a combination of purposely selected centres that historically have reported more cases, which in turn resemble the health service referral patterns of patients and health seeking behaviour; together with a higher incidence of dengue in specific geographical areas. Our data therefore describes the long term trends of dengue, but does not provide reliable data of its prevalence across geographical areas. A further limitation of our data is that diagnostic tests have changed over the years. These changes modify the proportion of tests that are positive, particularly the implementation of RT-qPCR in 2010, which is more sensitive than the cell culture-based methods it replaced, and are more efficient to process samples, increasing testing capacity and allowing screening a larger numbers of cases. Therefore the proportion of positive results would have varied over the years due to changes in tests performance and the varied case definitions used to select the samples for screening.</p>
