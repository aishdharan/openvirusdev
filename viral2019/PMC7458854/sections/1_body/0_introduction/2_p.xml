<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 are not specific and the disease manifestation can vary from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and death. According to a WHO report based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases,
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> typical signs and symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, and sore throat. In the case of fatality, the patient may die from a cytokine storm, the body's rapid immune response caused by the virus.
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Even after COVID-19 is cured, the antibody may not last for a long time, and the possibility that COVID-19 can recur in many treated patients is being investigated.
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Also, current diagnostic kits are not perfect and show false negatives of about 3%.
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, failure to detect a small number of cases of the potentially deadly viral infection causes virus spread. The current real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test detects SARS-CoV-2-related genetic material, the COVID-19 disease-causing virus.
