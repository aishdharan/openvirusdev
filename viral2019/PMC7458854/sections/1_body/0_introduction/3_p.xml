<p>Researchers at UT-Austin in the US analyzed about 450 cases of infection in 93 cities in China and found that more than 10% of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic.
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The period of serial interval (continuous infection) of the virus, which was the time taken from the time the infected person showed symptoms until the second infected person showed symptoms, was only 4 days on average. As a measure of the transmission rate of infectious diseases, the shorter the serial interval, the faster the transmission rate. In the study, the rate of transmission of COVID-19 was analyzed to be as fast as the seasonal flu. In order to respond to the rapid spread of COVID-19, appropriate virus spread models should be established for each country, and accordingly, inspection kits, screening clinics, and infectious disease treatment hospitals should be equipped more rapidly and aggressively.
