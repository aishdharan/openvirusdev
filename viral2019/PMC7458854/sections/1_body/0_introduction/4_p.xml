<p>Unlike the general spread of viruses, the new coronavirus spread rapidly in Korea, mainly from religious groups and nursing homes.
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Through these collective infections, the new virus spread rapidly within a much shorter time than the infectious disease spreading curve of the infectious disease spread model. In particular, most of the elderly patients in nursing homes have significant underlying diseases, and due to additional COVID-19 infection, the mortality rate in Korea was higher compared to the mortality rate for common COVID-19 infection.
