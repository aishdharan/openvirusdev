<p>In this paper, we analyzed the rapid virus spread and recovery trend by mass infection in Korea using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model.
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> By analyzing the inconsistency between the SEIRD model and the trend of infection caused by mass infections, this study derives the infection reproduction number, the date of the inflection point, the mortality rate of the elderly with underlying disease, and the difference between the epidemic peak and recovery for each region.
