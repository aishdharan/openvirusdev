 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The parameters for the SEIRD model were set by the data analysis results for Wuhan city, China and Gyeongbuk, Daegu, Korea. We assumed no further transmission would occur once a person entered into the status of R. 
 <italic>S</italic> was set to (
 <italic>P</italic>-
 <italic>I</italic>[0]-
 <italic>E</italic>[0]), total city population (
 <italic>P</italic>) excluding the initially infected and exposed population.
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 <italic>E</italic> was set as 20 times that of 
 <italic>I</italic> in accordance with Wang et al.
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and Read et al.
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 <italic>R</italic>(0) and

The median time from disease onset to diagnosis among confirmed patients was previously found to be 5 days.
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> On this basis, our γ was set as 0.0556(= 1/18) while various γ were presented in earlier research.
