<p>The delay of actual recovery can be confirmed in a recent report on the release of containment in Daegu city.
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the simulation of this paper, the hospitalization period was set to 18 days based on the results of existing COVID-19 studies,
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> but the actual recovery trend was not accurately predicted. The results of these recovery simulations indicate that recovery delays may occur by country and region. According to Daegu city,
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> as a result of investigating the treatment period of about 5,000 diagnosed patients, the average treatment period was 24.8 days. It was found that it took more than 20 days for 73% of all confirmed cases in Daegu to be cured. In addition, the average treatment period for people who healed completely from COVID-19 and were under the age of 30 was 24.7 days, and the treatment period between the ages of 30 and 69 years was 24.8 days; thus there was little difference in treatment period by age group observed in our study. We further note that the treatment period for patients aged 70 or older was 25.6 days, similar to other treatment periods. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the average duration of release of sequestered patients by management type was 25.3 days for hospitals, 24.4 days for living treatment facilities, and 22.7 days for self-isolation. In addition, it took a little longer for the relatively severe patients admitted to the hospital to be released from quarantine.
