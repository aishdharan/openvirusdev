 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> shows the actual data and the modeling results by SEIRD model for Seoul and Gyeonggi. Unlike the short-term explosive mass infections in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk regions, the number of infected people in the Seoul-Gyeonggi regions increased and decreased sporadically on a small scale via general spread. As shown in the fitted infection trend curve, the spread of infection increased slowly and there were three to four small spreads in both regions shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Although the

 <sub>R.C</sub>, unlike the mass infection in Daegu-Gyeongbuk. The recovery period of COVID-19, regardless of whether it was a mass infection or a normal infection, was quite long in Korea as described in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, resulting in a delay in the actual recovery trend. While Gyeonggi had a high mortality rate compared to the number of confirmed patients, Seoul's mortality rate was significantly lower than in other regions.
