 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the number of deaths and mortality rates by age among confirmed patients in Korea.
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The mortality rate applied to Gyeongbuk was set to 4.34%, which was much higher than the rates in previous reports.
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This value was higher than the mortality rate for participants in their 60s (60â€“69), which was also due to the mass infection of the elderly with underlying diseases in nursing homes, the main infectious factor in the Gyeongbuk. In addition, the relatively high mortality rate in Daegu was due to mass infections among religious groups, and it was estimated that the age range of infected people in Daegu was rather high. Mortality rates from previous studies did not adequately estimate the death curve for the elderly with mass infection and underlying disease, because most of the deaths in Korea were those with underlying disease who were over 60 years of age. Because the number of infected people in Seoul and Gyeonggi was much lower than that of Daegu and Gyeongbuk, it was not easy to infer the correlation between mortality rate due to normal infection and age and underlying disease in their region.
