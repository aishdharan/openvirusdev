<p>Unlike the general virus outbreak, the spread of COVID-19 in Korea has been rapid, particularly in closed spaces such as religious organizations and nursing homes in Daegu-Gyeongbuk. In contrast, general community infections excluding such closed spaces progressed slowly due to the active use of masks and disinfectants by citizens. Therefore, the rapid spread in the early stages of infection was limited to specific religious groups and nursing hospital communities rather than representing all of Daegu-Gyeongbuk (or Korea). It may be difficult to estimate the spread of the virus due to such an unusual mass infection using a general epidemic model.</p>
