<p>The spread and status of COVID-19 in Daegu-Gyeongbuk was as follows. First, the number of infected people in Daegu-Gyeongbuk accounted for 76% of the total number of infected people in Korea, and it had spread to specific communities within Daegu-Gyeongbuk. Second, the explosion of infection occurred within 10 days after the initial infection and lasted for 2 weeks, and then began to fade. Third, due to active social distance and the use of masks, the proliferation of communities with COVID-19 outbreaks other than specific communities that were sources of infection had progressed relatively slowly. Fourth, large-scale examinations through screening clinics and drive-through examinations in the early stages of the spread of infection enabled accurate statistics of the increase in confirmatory patients. Fifth, Korea has a high patient acceptance rate of treatment facilities that can cope with the rapidly growing confirmed infection rates.</p>
