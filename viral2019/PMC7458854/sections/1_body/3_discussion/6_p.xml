<p>It is not easy to explain the mass infections in Daegu-Gyeongbuk described above as a general epidemic model. Although the parameters used in the SEIRD model were set based on the results of a recent COVID-19 study, the model used did not accurately describe the spreading characteristics within Daegu-Gyeongbuk. Nevertheless, this paper analyzed the early appearance of epidemic peaks and slow recovery trends by mass infection by comparing the difference between epidemic peaks and recovery trends between the actual trend and the epidemic model. This characterization of mass infection is useful for inferring the preparation time of necessary medical resources in the future, and can also be used to derive the hospitalization period of the infectious group (older in this paper than in previous research) that directly affects the recovery trend.</p>
