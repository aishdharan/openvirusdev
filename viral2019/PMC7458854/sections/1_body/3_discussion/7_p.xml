<p>Mass infection was the largest factor affecting the COVID-19 spread in Korea and occurred intensively in a short period of time, earlier than the epidemic peak date predicted in the existing SEIRD model. Modeling studies of mass infections have more variables to be considered compared to general virus outbreaks. When a mass infection occurs, the initial virus response time is much shorter than for normal spread. Therefore, in order to prepare for the second epidemic of COVID-19, rapid research on collective infections by country and region is essential, and a command system should be established to prepare medical resources within the predicted epidemic peak date.</p>
