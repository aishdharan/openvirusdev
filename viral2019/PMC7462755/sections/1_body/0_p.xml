<p id="p0025">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been prevalent in China since the end of 2019 [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. By May 19th, COVID-19 had spread worldwide, with a total of almost five million confirmed cases [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, the Chinese Government established several measures to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as the establishment of a cordon sanitaire in Hubei Province, strict controls on travel, the quarantine of suspected cases and those in contact with confirmed cases [
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Chinese people have also taken measures such as wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, and maintaining social distancing. Those interventions have been suggested useful in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. How this COVID-19 outbreak and the related unprecedented measures influence other infectious diseases, such as influenza, remains unknown. In this work, we collected the influenza-positive rate from the tested ILI cases in China in the 2019â€“2020 influenza season and compared the results with those from previous influenza seasons to evaluate how COVID-19 and the following measures influenced influenza activity.
