<p id="p0030">We collected surveillance data from the Chinese National Influenza Center website [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], including all the testing samples and the number of influenza-positive samples (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). The total sample number decreased sharply since late January, which may have been due to the great need for COVID-19 testing. The overall positive number gradually reduced from the beginning of January and reached a shallow level in March. To fairly evaluate the prevalence of influenza, we mapped the positive rate, as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A with a green line. The positive rate decreased from the beginning of 2020, approaching zero in March. We further calculated the positive rates for southern and northern China separately, as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, to have found similar decreasing trends.
