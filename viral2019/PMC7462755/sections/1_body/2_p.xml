<p id="p0035">To evaluate the difference between regular influenza seasons and the influenza season under the COVID-19 outbreak, we collected surveillance data of 2016–2017, 2017–2018, and 2018–2019 seasons from the Chinese National Influenza Center website [

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> , it was apparent that the positive rate decreased much earlier in the 2019–2020 season than in the previous three seasons. In week 7 of 2020, the positive rate was already below 10%, while for 2016–2017, 2017–2018, and 2018–2019 seasons, the positive rates decreased to below 10% at weeks 18, 13, and 25.
