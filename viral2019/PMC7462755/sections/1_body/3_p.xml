 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). Subtype H3N2 predominated from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020, then it rapidly decreased, beginning in the second week (Jan. 6-Jan. 12, 2020) and dropped to less than 5% by week 6. Subtype H1N1 and lineage B were at low levels during the 2019–2020 flu season and declined approximately one month later than H3N2. In southern China, subtype H3N2 and lineage B predominated, and the positive rate of H3N2 was higher than that of lineage B from November 2019 to mid-January 2020. Then, beginning in late January 2020, lineage B dominated and declined to start in February. In northern China, subtype H3N2 dominated in the 2019–2020 flu season and tended to start at the beginning of the year, and subtype H1N1 and lineage B were at shallow levels and declined to start in February. In the 2018–2019 influenza season (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B), H1N1 predominated from November 2018 to early March 2019. After H1N1 declined to a low level, influenza B arose and predominated beginning in late March and declined to be below 10% in June. Influenza H3N2 was also mild in China during this season. In the 2017–2018 influenza season (Fig. 3C), lineage B arose quickly in the beginning, while H1N1 exceeded and became predominant beginning in late January 2018. H3N2 was mild in the 2017–2018 season, with a positive rate of no more than 10% in both southern and northern China. In the 2016–2017 influenza season (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D), H3N2 predominated from the beginning to late February. After H3N2 declined to a low level, H1N1 exhibited a slight increase (mainly in northern China) and dropped soon after.
