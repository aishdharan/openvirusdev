<p id="p0045">In conclusion, we have found that the influenza season ended much earlier in 2020 than in previous years. According to the China CDC Weekly Report [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the confirmed cases (by date of symptom onset) of COVID-19 outside Hubei mainly arose starting in January. They reached a peak on January 27th, which is consistent with a recent work that considered different versions of the case definition [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and this peak occurred soon after the cordon sanitaire was imposed in Wuhan city. For influenza, we observed a significant decline in the total testing samples for influenza beginning in late January, which may be due to the increased testing capacity for COVID-19. The positive rate somehow reflected the severity of influenza, which reached a peak in the first week of 2020 and then decreased. The positive rate for influenza exhibited a sharp decrease after interventions for COVID-19 were imposed in late January and reached a shallow level within several weeks. A similar phenomenon for influenza was also observed in Taiwan and Singapore [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb5000" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. For the past three seasons, after the positive rate reached its peak, there was possibly a slight decrease, but it remained at a high level for a relatively long time.
