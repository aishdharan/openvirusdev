 <p id="Par1">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing the respiratory illness termed as the coronavirus disease 2019 or the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, the significant increase in deaths in the current days due to influenza around the world started in 1889 is a continued public health threat because of its intermittent style of pandemic outbreaks. An array of research on the influenza viruses has been conducted especially pointing on (1) the development of the anti-viral drugs and the design of probable vaccines on trial basis, (2) the biochemical and genetic aspects underlying the viral pathogenicity, (3) the viral epidemiology, and on (4) the protective immunity against the influenza viruses. Current review briefly discussed the epidemic/ pandemic history of influenza and correlated with the current epidemiology, the possible preventive measures that may be taken by the public health professionals as well as to increase the protective awareness among the general people. The viral reassortments during the initiation of pandemics have also been focused based on the previous literatures.</p>
