<p id="Par3">The 1918 influenza pandemic, the most severe one in the history, occurred in three waves: first at Spring 1918, second one at Fall 1918 (the death cases were the highest), and the third wave at the Winter 1918 and the Spring at 1919, suggesting that a pandemic can dreadfully harm the global human lives especially regarding morbidity and mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Along with a "very high alert” for the pandemic announced by the regulatory bodies, scientists usually concentrate on the transmission of viruses, viral pathogenesis, the associated host immunity, effectual diagnosis of the disease, and the preventive therapeutic strategies including the possible vaccine development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although a scientific discussion usually focuses primarily on the biomedical research advances along with the disease mitigation possibilities, the control of any pandemic largely requires the preventive realization within the broader demographic, socioeconomic, cultural, and even the political context at all levels regardless the local, regional, national or international levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Indeed, responding to any pandemic with the highest level of emergency is of prime significance to limit the viral transmission and eventually to maintain the global public health sustainability. Such responses may include medical interventions, appropriate drug designing and vaccine development, research on the host immune responses during viral pathogenesis and the evolution of virus, detecting virus transmission, rapid and accurate diagnosis, and various preventive measures along with the public awareness, etc.[
