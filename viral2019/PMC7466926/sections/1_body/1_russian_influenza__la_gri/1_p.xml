<p id="Par4">Russian Flu, the first true epidemic cases observed in May 1889 (in Bukhara, Turkestan; in Athabasca, Canada, and in Greenland), was another outbreak caused by the Influenza A virus subtype H2N2; however, recently it is thought that the subtype was actually H3N8 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The flu specifically spread into the urban areas prior to propagate into the whole world, ultimately causing over a million of deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Only a small fraction of the population got affected during the first three months; however, after that four‐fifths of the people were noticed to be severely affected without any early symptoms of influenza [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Briefly it is to be noted that the mortality rate was higher among the elderly people in 1889–1890 pandemic whereas this pattern was dominantly noticed among the young people during the 1918–1919 pandemic outbreaks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is an interesting factor to note that influenza was attributed to a

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, a hypothesis was drawn that young adults could have increased risk of dying from the Spanish flu in 1918–1920 (the H1N1 subtype) if they had been previously infected by the Russian flu (1889–1890) [
