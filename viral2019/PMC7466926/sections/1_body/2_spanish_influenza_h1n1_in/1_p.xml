<p id="Par6">As stated above, the Spanish influenza pandemic was in three consecutive waves: spring 1918, autumn 1918, and winter 1918–19, responsible for killing approximately 50 million people worldwide with abnormally severe clinical manifestations among the healthy and young adults [

Moreover, lack of cellular immunity as well as the pre-existing virus-specific and/or cross-reactive antibodies, individual genetic makeup like the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), co-infections with bacterial pathogens, and with the measles and malaria causing agents; and finally the malnutrition or obesity has been found to contribute to the high mortality due to the 1918 H1N1 virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Though the 1918 influenza pandemic is known as the “Spanish Flue”; in real the 1918 influenza virus didn’t originate in Spain; rather it originated in the Midwest of the United States of America and then France, from where the viral transmission spread throughout Europe and within the rest of the world [

Being a segmented virus, influenza virus was capable of undergoing the reassortment process which is known to occur when two influenza virus strains co-infect the same cell, thereby triggering the evolution of a novel “reassortant” virus consisting of an unusual assemblage of genes [
