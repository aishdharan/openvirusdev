<p id="Par8">Regarding the preparation or development of Influenza virus vaccines, a major shortfall underlies the fact that antibodies elicited by the seasonal influenza vaccines cannot impart protection in the case of an antigenically distinct influenza virus of a novel subtype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. More specifically, during the interpandemic periods, the antigenic drift (mutations in the genes of influenza viruses) variants may arise which in turn created difficulties in the development of a corresponding vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The mutations in the genes lead to changes in the HA and NA surface proteins (serving as antigens) which are to be recognized by the immune system with the concomitant triggering of the protective immunity and the production of specific antibodies blocking the infection. One potential strategy to counter this problem has been noticed when a trivalent hemagglutinin DNA prime-trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) boost regimen (the 2012/13 seasonal trivalent HA DNA vaccine; i.e., VRC-FLUDNA063-00-VP) was developed to cure the children suffering from seasonal influenza in the US [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In healthy adults, such DNA influenza vaccines against the emerging subtypes of avian origin (including H5 and H7) administered as a prime injection prior to an inactivated boost was observed to increase the overall antibody titers [
