<p id="Par15">In contrast the SARS-CoV-2 is principally causing headache, fever, sore throat, cough, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, upper airway congestion, pharyngalgia, myalgia, and diarrhea, anemia, and even the secondary infections [

Interestingly, the etiological agent that caused 50 million deaths in 1918–919 was unknown at that very time (will be discussed later); but since that old time the world has experienced three additional influenza pandemics: the 1957 “Asian” influenza pandemic, the 1968 “Hong Kong” influenza pandemic (described in the descendent paragraphs) and the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [

It is to be pondered that both the ongoing infection SARS-CoV-2 and the previous SARS-CoV infections are associated with the elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (cytokine storm) while the pathogenicity of MERS-CoV is based on its interferon (IFN) antagonist proteins [
