<p id="Par18">The 1918 H1N1 subtype pandemic followed the H2N2 pandemic in 1957; and the third pandemic was caused by H3N2 subtype in 1968. An integrated interplay between viral genome, host immunity including the dysregulated pro-inflammatory response, and societal factors are usually responsible for morbidity and mortality due to any epidemic- or pandemic outbreak [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Lack of appropriate humoral immunity; i.e., the pre-existing virus-specific and/or cross-reactive antibodies and the shortage in the cellular immunity can be another promoting factor for the onset of viral infection [

Besides, (1) the genetic factors such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), (2) the co-infections with other bacterial pathogens, (3) malnutrition, (4) obesity, (5) population demographics, (6) antibiotic resistance, (7) climate change, etc. may influence the dreadfulness of influenza virus infections [
