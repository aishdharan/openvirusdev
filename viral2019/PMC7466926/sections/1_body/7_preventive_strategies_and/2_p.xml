<p id="Par19">Quick identification of suspect cases is the major step to limit the spread of any transmissible virus. The identification based on the molecular biological tools like the sequencing and annotation of the viral genome as well as the development of rapid diagnostic tests may facilitate the isolation of the infected persons to ensure othersâ€™ safety [

In the current time, the diagnosis of viral strains responsible for influenza has spectacularly improved both in terms of accuracy, speed and sensitivity by means of an array of molecular diagnostic techniques. Moreover, the risk assessment of the pandemic viruses has also improved through the screening of the viral genome within the infected individuals. Monitoring the possible mutations within the viral genome is also possible.
