<p id="Par21">An array of informative reports on especially the pathogenicity and epidemiology on the pandemics of influenza viruses are now a days well available in a huge scientific and social database. Such information indeed, from the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 to the current COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, have been really helpful to develop different approaches prevent the circulation of the different influenza subtypes and the dreadful Î²-coronaviruses; as well as to treat the virally infected patients. Both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions have been developed including the development of drug/vaccine development, implementation of quarantine measures, wearing protective cloths with glove and masks, limiting the global travelling, maintain proper hygiene, etc. The medical interventions employed different anti-viral drugs and tried for the development of vaccines; however, no appropriate vaccine has been developed till date to circumvent these respiratory viruses. Rather, proper medical nursing seemed to be useful along with ventilation. To counteract the antigenic drift as stated earlier, increased surveillance is needed along with the novel strategies to develop the vaccine composition, production, formulation, presentation, and delivery.</p>
