 <caption> Simple illustration of viral reassortment between the influenza viruses. After the 1918–1920 Spanish influenza outbreak the 1918 A/H1N1 subtype (thought to be generated from manifold reassortments between avian-, swine-, and human borne viruses) was likely to circulate continuously and thereby triggering the subsequent epidemics [ 20]. In 1957 the A/H1N1 subtype was depicted to be reassorted with an avian A/H2N2 virus, which circulated until 1968, and reassorted again with the avian H3Nx virus [ 37]. In 1977 the A1/H1N1 virus was reestablished among the humans (contained the M gene segment of 1918 origin, encoding the matrix protein, M1 and M2, grossly required for the viral pathogenecity) and was co-circulated with H3N2 viruses till 2009 [ 20, 36, 38, 39] when it was thought to be swapped by another A/H1N1 subtype, H1N1pdm2009 [ 38] as a result of the numerous reassortments between avian-, swine-, and human influenza viruses yy[ 20, 36– 38]. This is to be noted that such viral reaasortments have not been shown between the SARS or SARS-CoV2 in this illustration. PB2 Polymerase basic protein 2, involved in transcription initiation and cap stealing mechanism; PA polymerase acidic protein, involved in viral RNA transcription and replication; NP nuceloprotein, involved in the encapsulation of the viral genome for RNA transcription, replication and packaging; M matrix protein, involved in the formation of the viral envelope; NS non-structural protein, involved in the inhibition of host immune responses; PB1: Polymerase basic protein 1, a determinant of the influenza virus virulence; HA hemagglutinin, a homotrimeric glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza viruses which is integral to its infectivity, and is involved in the viral attachment and acts as a membrane fusion protein.; NA neuraminidase, involved in cleaving sialic acid groups from glycoproteins and are required for influenza virus replication; i.e., it is essential for release of progeny virus particles from the surface of an infected cell </caption>
