  <p>Simple illustration of viral reassortment between the influenza viruses. After the 1918–1920 Spanish influenza outbreak the 1918 A/H1N1 subtype (thought to be generated from manifold reassortments between avian-, swine-, and human borne viruses) was likely to circulate continuously and thereby triggering the subsequent epidemics [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In 1957 the A/H1N1 subtype was depicted to be reassorted with an avian A/H2N2 virus, which circulated until 1968, and reassorted again with the avian H3Nx virus [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In 1977 the A1/H1N1 virus was reestablished among the humans (contained the M gene segment of 1918 origin, encoding the matrix protein, M1 and M2, grossly required for the viral pathogenecity) and was co-circulated with H3N2 viruses till 2009 [

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] as a result of the numerous reassortments between avian-, swine-, and human influenza viruses yy[

   <italic>PB2</italic> Polymerase basic protein 2, involved in transcription initiation and cap stealing mechanism; 
   <italic>PA</italic> polymerase acidic protein, involved in viral RNA transcription and replication; 
   <italic>NP</italic> nuceloprotein, involved in the encapsulation of the viral genome for RNA transcription, replication and packaging; 
   <italic>M</italic> matrix protein, involved in the formation of the viral envelope; 
   <italic>NS</italic> non-structural protein, involved in the inhibition of host immune responses; PB1: Polymerase basic protein 1, a determinant of the influenza virus virulence; 
   <italic>HA</italic> hemagglutinin, a homotrimeric glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza viruses which is integral to its infectivity, and is involved in the viral attachment and acts as a membrane fusion protein.; 
   <italic>NA</italic> neuraminidase, involved in cleaving sialic acid groups from glycoproteins and are required for influenza virus replication; i.e., it is essential for release of progeny virus particles from the surface of an infected cell
