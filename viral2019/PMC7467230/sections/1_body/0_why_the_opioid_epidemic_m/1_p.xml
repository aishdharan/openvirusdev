<p>The epidemiology of the US opioid epidemic continues to evolve and presents new challenges. In recent years, the epidemic has shifted from prescription opioid pills to injection of illicitly produced opioids, including heroin and fentanyl, with concomitant increasing injection of stimulants including cocaine and methamphetamine [

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteremia, endocarditis, and skin and soft tissue infections, is rising [

 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–11</xref>]. Injection of fentanyl or heroin alone and in combination with stimulants have led to new HIV outbreaks among people who use drugs throughout the country [
