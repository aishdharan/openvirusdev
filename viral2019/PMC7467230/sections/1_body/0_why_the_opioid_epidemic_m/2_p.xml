<p>At the State of the Union Address in February 2019, President Trump called for a plan to end HIV as an epidemic in the United States. This plan seeks to reduce new infections by 75% in the next 5 years and by 90% in the next 10 years. Even amid the opioid epidemic, such ambitious goals can be achieved if policy changes occur and adequate resources are provided. Thus, more than ever, addressing the HIV epidemic as well as HCV and other IDU-related infections also requires a focus on the opioid and co-occurring stimulant epidemics. Doing so will improve patientsâ€™ outcomes and reduce the public health risk of infectious disease transmission. Nevertheless, a number of barriers to care in people who use drugs need to be addressed to end the opioid and HIV epidemics in the United States as well as reduce the other infectious disease health outcomes. To address these barriers we recommend expanding Medicaid, expanding access to harm reduction services, improving treatment and surveillance to enhance the continuum of care, and treating opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD), including through low-barrier hospital and community-based treatment, as well as in the criminal justice setting.</p>
