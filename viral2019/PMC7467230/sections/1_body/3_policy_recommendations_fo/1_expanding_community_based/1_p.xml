<p>In addition to state and jurisdictional bans or restrictions on syringe services programs (SSP), funding remains a significant barrier to expanding access to SSP services [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Increased state and federal funding are needed to expand SSP and other harm reduction services, including access to MOUD and infectious diseases treatment services in order to decrease HCV, HIV, IDU-related infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases, and improve OUD-related outcomes [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that incorporation of SSPs combined with MOUD is associated with a decrease in HCV and HIV acquisition risk by 76% and 34%, respectively [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. SSPs also can facilitate vaccine uptake for hepatitis A virus (HAV), HBV, influenza, and invasive pneumococcal disease, which disproportionately impact people who inject drugs or experience unstable housing or homelessness [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. SSPs can offer a safe space without stigma for individuals with SUDs to also receive counseling regarding safe sexual practice, safe injection practice, and provision of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and contraception. SSPs that also provide treatment for OUD can facilitate linkage to care for effective evidence-based treatments [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, persons with SUDs may be reluctant to seek nonemergent care for skin and soft tissue infections and postpone medical evaluation until the need is more urgent. Providing care for skin and soft tissue infections in a supported setting may reduce progression to serious infections and reduce complications like wound botulism or partial drainage of abscesses.
