<p>In addition to SSPs, other harm reduction services are needed to address the expanding epidemics. Overdose prevention sites (also known as supervised injection facilities or safe injection sites) are facilities in which persons can inject drugs in a safe, clean environment under medical supervision. Overdose prevention sites enable rapid, life-saving intervention in the case of drug overdose and can also provide injection equipment and referrals to care for SUD and other health care services. Overdose prevention sites have existed for many years in Europe, Australia, and Canada. Studies of overdose prevention sites in Vancouver and Sydney have found an increase in withdrawal management or detoxification service referrals and a decrease in drug overdose rates, syringe sharing, public injections, and publicly discarded syringes [

Although concerns have been raised about violation of federal and state drug laws, overdose prevention sites have been legally established successfully in areas outside of the United States. Review of the processes and experience could facilitate implementation in US jurisdictions that have approved overdose prevention sites. Jurisdictions that have approved overdose prevention sites should be allowed to implement and evaluate the intervention in the United States.
