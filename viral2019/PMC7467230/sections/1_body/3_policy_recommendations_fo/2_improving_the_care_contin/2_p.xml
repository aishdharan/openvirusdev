<p>As a next step, treatment programs that integrate substance use care and treatment for infectious complications in order to improve outcomes are needed. Treatment of both the SUD and associated infections (eg, HIV, HCV) can be cost-effective and is associated with improved infection and SUD outcomes [
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that patients with either HIV or HCV who receive MOUDs have improved viral suppression (HIV) [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], achieve sustained virologic response/cure (HCV) [
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and have increased retention in care [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the role substance use treatment plays in caring for people with other IDU-related infections, such as endocarditis, deep tissue abscesses, skin and soft tissue infections, and bone and joint infections. One innovative care model combined outpatient parenteral therapy with buprenorphine treatment and showed similar clinical and drug use outcomes to completing inpatient therapy and resulted in reduced hospital length of stay by 24 days [
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Studies are needed to evaluate novel approaches to antimicrobial treatment for IDU-associated infections such as the role of long-acting glycopeptides. Increased funding is necessary for other demonstration projects and pilot studies to identify effective care models for comanagement of infectious diseases and OUD as well as other SUDs.
