<p>Finally, to monitor progress of these interventions, we need a standardized mechanism for reporting IDU-related infections. Other than for HIV and, in some states, for HCV infection, there is no national database of IDU-related infections for surveillance, prevention activities, and program evaluation. This makes it difficult—if not impossible—to identify, predict, and prevent new infectious disease epidemics related to substance use in the United States. In addition, the majority of federal funding has been directed towards opioid overdose treatment and HIV resultant from IDU, but not toward the bacterial and fungal infection complications, partly due to lack of integrated surveillance systems for serious IDU-related infections, such as endocarditis. Developing national surveillance systems to track and predict new epidemics before they happen and increasing National Institutes of Health funding for research into other infectious diseases related to the worsening SUD epidemics in this country are urgently needed.</p>
