<p>Over half of the criminal justice-involved population (CJIP) have OUD or SUD, with a 10-fold higher prevalence than found in the general adult population [
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. As such, employing and enforcing evidence-based treatment guidelines that address the overlap of SUD and infectious diseases in the criminal justice system has the potential to improve morbidity and mortality substantially. Key components include evaluating new entrants for SUD and IDU-related infections, integrating MOUD and counseling services during incarceration, providing both appropriate medical care during incarceration and harm reduction during and after incarceration, care coordination, seamless referral to outpatient care for SUD and chronic infections, and uninterrupted insurance coverage for CJIP.
