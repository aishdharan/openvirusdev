<p>Intertwined with national increases in SUD and incarceration rates, there have been substantial increases in HIV and HCV in CJIP, as well as outbreaks of HAV and HBV [
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Inequities that exist in health care access in the community are amplified by criminal justice involvement, leading to premature deaths [
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Mortality rates are high following release, primarily driven by untreated OUD leading to fatal overdose, progression of HIV, and HBV/HCV-induced liver disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">66–68</xref>]. Additionally, overall infectious disease testing rates and rates of vaccination against HAV and HBV are low [
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Integration of infectious disease management with treatment for OUD in CJIP is an endorsed strategy for reducing these health inequities that will likely lead to improved infectious disease outcomes and facilitates linkage to care postrelease [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Despite the evidence, however, few incarcerated settings offer MOUD. SUD screening in jails and prisons with linkage to substance use treatment also decreases postrelease mortality [
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and increases postrelease HIV viral suppression [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Clearly, prevention and treatment for OUD and associated infections in this population can improve both individual outcomes and public health, especially when initiated during incarceration. Time spent in prison or jail provides a reachable moment—an opportunity to engage a vulnerable population. Screening for OUD and treatment with MOUD need to be integrated into jails and prisons to improve substance use and infectious diseases outcomes.
