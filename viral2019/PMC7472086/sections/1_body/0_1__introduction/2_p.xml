<p>In the past, AGE was generally attributed to a single causative agent known to be associated with clinical symptoms. However, due to their high prevalence, exposure to multiple viruses at similar times can potentially occur in the same host, and these viruses may either infect simultaneously or within a short window of time. The outcomes of either infection may thus be influenced by the combined contribution of multiple agents. With increasing capacity to efficiently analyze samples for the presence of multiple putative pathogens using quantitative real-time PCR approaches, our appreciation that more than one virus may be present in an infected individual has grown. Enteric virus co-infections are commonly identified for all viruses linked to AGE [

Despite our increased awareness of the prevalence of enteric viral co-infections, however, the mechanisms underlying viral co-infection have not yet been carefully explored. There are significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the dynamics between co-infecting agents and how these influence disease severity, immune responses, or vaccine efficacy.
