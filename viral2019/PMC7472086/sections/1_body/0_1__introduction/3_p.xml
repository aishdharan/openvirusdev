<p>Here, we will review what is known about the clinical aspects of enteric virus co-infection and discuss potential models to investigate viral co-infection in vitro and in vivo. We will first summarize what is known about enteric viral co-infection prevalence and its impact on health and disease, as well as how vaccine responses may be influenced by co-infection events. Second, we will present several of the possible cellular and molecular consequences of enteric viral co-infections. Finally, we will conclude by exploring past and current model systems used to study viral infections in the gut that could be applied to co-infections.</p>
