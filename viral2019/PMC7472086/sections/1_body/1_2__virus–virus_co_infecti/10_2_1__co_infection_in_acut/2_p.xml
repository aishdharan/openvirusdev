<p>During epidemic AGE outbreaks, such as those that occur from contaminated water, co-infection with multiple unrelated viruses can be common. For example, in a pediatric AGE outbreak in Finland, in which drinking water was contaminated by sewage, RV was detected in 66% of cases, calicivirus including either NoV or SaV in 62%, and both in 40% [

 <xref rid="B98-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Even in community AGE, however, co-infections make up a moderate proportion of cases and are likely under-reported as some etiologic agents may not be tested for across all studies.
