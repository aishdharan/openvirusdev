<p>The introduction of the RV vaccine altered the prevalence of RV infection, but it continues to be frequently detected during AGE. A study of enteric RNA virus co-infections in diarrheic children and adults in Southwestern Canada found that 2.8% of total RNA virus-positive samples showed combinations of NoV GII-SaV, NoV GII-RV, NoV GII-AstV, SaV-AstV, and SaV-RV at varying percentages [

Overall, these studies support that in healthy children and adults experiencing AGE episodes, between ~3â€“50% may have more than one viral pathogen present. Some reports indicate that RV co-infections, at least in healthy children, are not associated with greater symptom severity than single RV infection [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], while another reported that co-infections with NoV may lead to more severe AGE with enhanced comorbidities, such as vomiting and fever, compared to NoV alone [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Further clinical studies exploring the effects of co-infection on symptom severity are needed to better clarify the relative contribution of co-infection to disease outcomes.
