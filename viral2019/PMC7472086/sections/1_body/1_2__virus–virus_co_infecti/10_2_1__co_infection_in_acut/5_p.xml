<p>Even less clear, however, are the impacts of co-infection in immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised patients have been reported to have only slightly higher prevalence of individual enteric viral pathogens as the general population [

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], but may experience both more symptomatic and prolonged infections [

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. A potential consequence of prolonged infection in immunocompromised patients and the elderly may be the intra-host evolution of genetically distinct viral populations and viral spread in nursing homes [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. A study comparing HIV-positive and HIV-negative children reported a higher prevalence of AstV and enterovirus co-infection in HIV-infected children, with multiple strains of AstV detected in HIV-infected children with or without AGE [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. An investigation in HIV-seropositive and -seronegative children with diarrhea in Brazil reported a significantly higher rate of co-infections with &gt;1 enteric virus including NoV, AdV and human bocavirus in HIV-1 seropositive children [
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. There have also been a number of case reports of severe co-infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as those of AdV and coxsackievirus detected in a child with a primary immunodeficiency with persistent severe diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], or AdV and NoV co-infection reported in a patient diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia undergoing stem cell transplantation [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Certainly, immunocompromised patients with AGE are at increased risk of complications and prolonged hospitalizations. The additional study of co-infections in both immunocompromised and elderly cohorts may help to provide insights into mechanisms related to the immune regulation of enteric viruses.
