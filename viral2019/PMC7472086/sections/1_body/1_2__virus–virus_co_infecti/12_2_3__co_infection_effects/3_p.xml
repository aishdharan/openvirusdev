<p>While most enteric viruses causing AGE do not have specific treatments available, an important note is that frequently diarrheal episodes are treated with antibiotics which have no efficacy against viral pathogens. In the MAL-ED multi-site study, almost half of all diarrheal episodes were treated with antibiotics. Analysis later showed that 91.7% of these antibiotic courses were inappropriate [

Thus, improved recognition and detection of the enteric viruses that mediate AGE, as well as an appreciation that multiple viruses may be present to drive diarrheal disease, is increasingly important to limit unnecessary administration of antibiotics.
