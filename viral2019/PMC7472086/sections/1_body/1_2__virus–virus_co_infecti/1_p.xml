<p>By quantity and diversity, prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses in the human intestinal microbiota likely outnumber their bacterial counterparts, with the size of the virome still remaining largely unknown [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this review, we will predominantly focus on intestinal eukaryotic viruses as these are the known causative agents of AGE, but will briefly mention that co-infection relationships between bacteriophages play a major role in shaping complex microbial ecosystems [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Superinfection exclusion serves to limit subsequent phage infection of bacteria already having a prophage present, but in other contexts virusâ€“virus interactions may serve to facilitate infections especially when the co-infecting phage are highly distinct (for example, ssDNA and dsDNA phage) [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While phage co-infection interactions have predominantly been explored in vitro or in environmental samples, new evidence suggests phage co-infection is also occurring in the human gastrointestinal tract, and thus the interrogation of these interactions is likely to be an important aspect of future microbiota research [
