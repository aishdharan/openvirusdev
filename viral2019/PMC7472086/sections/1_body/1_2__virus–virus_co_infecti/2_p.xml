<p>Recently, the metagenomic sequencing analysis of stool samples of several cohorts of healthy neonates revealed a stepwise viral colonization model wherein prophages may be the viral pioneers in the gut at one month after birth while, by four months, eukaryotic viruses became prominent [

The first several years of life are then a particularly dramatic period of co-infection, and the simultaneous detection of multiple enteropathogens is common, both associated with AGE and even in the absence of symptoms. As an example of prevalence in early life, a cohort of Dutch infants had at least one enteropathogen, including eukaryotic viruses and bacterial pathogens, detected in ~73% of samples tested, and of these, nearly half had two distinct pathogens detected [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Indeed, 92% of the samples tested in this study were positive for one to five different viruses, and approximately half of the samples contained two or more viruses. Gut pathogens, including enteric viruses, are thus extremely common in early life, and virus–virus interactions, apart from being synergistically pathogenic, may play important roles in the development of the host–virome homeostatic relationship, as well as immune system education [
