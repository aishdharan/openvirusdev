<p>Risk factors for acquiring enteric co-infections include young age, daycare attendance, and households with more than three children [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], as well as contaminated drinking water and poor sanitation [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Children from high income regions often exhibit lower rates of co-infection than those from lower income regions. For example, using the same assay, one French study found a 7% co-infection rate, compared to a 77% co-infection rate observed in a cohort of Ghanaian children [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In one of the largest multi-site studies to look at pathogens associated with community diarrhea in developing countries, one enteropathogen was detected in 77% of diarrheal stools and 65% of non-diarrheal samples, and two or more pathogens in 41 and 29%, respectively, in the first two years of life [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, an improved understanding of the consequences of these extremely common co-infection events is critical. Below, we will briefly describe the major enteric viral pathogens, and then will detail what has been discovered about viral co-infection frequency worldwide.
