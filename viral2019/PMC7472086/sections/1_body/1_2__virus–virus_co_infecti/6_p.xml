 <italic>Astroviridae:</italic> Astroviruses (AstV) are causative agents of diarrheal disease particularly in children and immunocompromised patients. Few studies report AstV-mediated AGE in normal healthy adults, but most children are infected with AstV and develop antibodies to the virus early in life [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Classical AstV has eight serotypes (AstV1â€“8) that usually cause self-limiting infections but can spread systemically in immunocompromised individuals [
