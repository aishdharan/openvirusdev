 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>: Enterovirus species A and B (enteroviruses and coxsackieviruses), and C (polioviruses (PV)) are prevalent enteric pathogens causing a range of diseases, including AGE. PV is an enteric virus transmitted through the fecal–oral route, which during the pre-vaccine era could spread from the gut to the central nervous system to cause poliomyelitis, a disease leading to temporary or permanent paralysis [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Following the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, global vaccination programs led to the eradication of the indigenous wild PV type 2 in 2015 and type 3 in 2019 [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. PV vaccines include an inactivated PV (developed by Jonas Salk) administered via injection [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and a live attenuated PV (developed by Albert Sabin) administered orally—the oral polio vaccine (OPV) [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Both vaccines show high efficacy, but OPV is considerably easier to deploy in low-resource settings around the world and confers longer-lasting community immunity [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, in rare cases, OPV can revert to its pathogenic variant and provoke poliomyelitis [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and recent vaccine-derived PV outbreaks have been documented in several countries, highlighting the importance of continued PV research [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Enterovirus-A71 is closely associated and co-circulates with coxsackievirus-A16, causing seasonal outbreaks of HFMD in Central China, with reported co-infection in ~2% of cases [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In general, co-infection between enterovirus-A71 and other enteroviruses during HFMD outbreaks are associated with more severe symptoms [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. While human enteroviruses have not classically been associated with AGE, there is increasing appreciation that many of these viruses can be associated with pediatric diarrhea [
