 <italic>Adenoviridae</italic>: Adenoviruses (AdV) are non-enveloped DNA viruses known to cause conjunctivitis, upper and lower respiratory disease, and AGE. AdV can be transmitted via respiratory droplets, fomites, and fecalâ€“oral transmission, and predominantly infects the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Epidemiological data indicate that the majority of AdV infections occur in children less than 5 years of age, but AdV epidemics are also common in adults. AdV genotypes 40 and 41 are commonly associated with AGE in pediatric populations worldwide [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The intestinal tract also appears to be a common site of AdV reactivation under conditions of immunosuppression [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In patients with congenital immunodeficiencies, AdV can cause disseminated and other lethal disease [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], whereas in acquired immunodeficiency associated with HIV infection, AdV infections are more commonly associated with AGE [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Although AdV infection in the respiratory tract is well characterized, gastrointestinal infection is less well-understood in terms of cell tropism, entry mechanism and intestinal immune responses [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. AdV is prevalent in intestinal biopsies from healthy individuals, with co-infection by multiple strains commonly detected. AdV DNA has been found in lamina propria lymphocytes, but the full cellular tropism of human AdV remains unclear [
