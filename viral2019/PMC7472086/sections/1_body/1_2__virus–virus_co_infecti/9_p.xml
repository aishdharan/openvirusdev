 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the end of 2019 witnessed the beginning of an ongoing global pandemic from novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with nearly 19 million cases and &gt;706,000 deaths to date (as of 6 August 2020), dramatically increasing the awareness of these viral pathogens. SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor protein ACE2 for entry, which is expressed on lung epithelium but also on enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Infection is often associated with gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can be detected in fecal samples and viral antigens identified in intestinal tissues of COVID-19 patients [

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In addition, there is mounting evidence for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the intestines of animal models, such as macaques and ferrets [

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits milder clinical symptoms in children as compared to adults, prolonged fecal shedding has been observed in pediatric cases [

 <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. It has already been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection may prevent co-infection by other respiratory viruses [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. While it is still unclear if SARS-CoV-2 exhibits fecalâ€“oral transmission [

 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], the epidemic has raised important questions about this novel pathogen in the intestine and whether it may be an important future consideration in enteric viral co-infections.
