<p>Co-infections with related strains facilitate viral recombination, which can occur via homologous or non-homologous recombination, or reassortment. Improvements in viral genomic sequencing methods have facilitated the detection of recombinants, leading to accelerated detection of these events over the past decade. Enteroviruses have been frequently observed to recombine to permit the emergence of new viral strains [

 <xref rid="B128-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], and indeed OPV and circulating enteroviruses also have the capacity to generate recombinants with enhanced pathogenicity and fitness [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Recombination events are also frequent in human and animal AstV [

 <xref rid="B131-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Because RV is a segmented RNA virus, a concerning outcome for co-infection is reassortment of the viral genome that can facilitate the emergence of novel epidemic strains [
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. While there has been less evidence for AdV recombination during intestinal infection, it is certainly a possible outcome considering the frequently persistent presence of these viruses in the gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Cross-family viral recombination events are much less likely, but certainly not impossible [
