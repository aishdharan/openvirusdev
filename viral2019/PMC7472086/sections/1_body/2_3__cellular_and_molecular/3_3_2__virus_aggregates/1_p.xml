<p>Recent studies have revealed that multiple enteric eukaryotic viruses, including RV, NoV, and PV may be transmitted in aggregates or viral clusters [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>,
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Groups of assorted virions, often containing mutagenized genomes, are replicated and transmitted cell-to-cell in vesicle-like structures [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. For aggregation to occur, virions must be able to accumulate and be transmitted from infected cells to neighboring cells with minimal interference. Aggregation may offer viruses multiple advantages, including an increased cellular multiplicity of infection [
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], and greater opportunity for complementation or recombination to restore fitness [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Gut bacteria have been shown to facilitate the aggregation of PV, and this could be a mechanism of the bacterially-mediated enhancement of infection by other enteric viruses [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Fundamentally, aggregates serve as an important and newly-appreciated mechanism for the co-infection of multiple related virions. Whether aggregates have the potential to include multiple unrelated viruses, and their role in the cellular consequences of co-infections, remains to be seen.
