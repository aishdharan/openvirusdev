<p>Gnotobiotic pigs serve as a useful model to study human enteric viruses, as similarities to human gastrointestinal physiology and mucosal immune development provide significant advantages over other model systems [

 <xref rid="B154-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. The capacity to introduce defined microbial consortia and/or study the effects of infection in the absence of the microbiota also add a layer of utility to these models. Piglets have been used extensively to study human RV and NoV infection, as they exhibit diarrheal disease, gastroenteritis, and fecal viral shedding, and have been useful for antibody response studies [

 <xref rid="B155-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. For example, the detection of human NoV capsid protein in small intestinal enterocytes of infected pigs associated with increased apoptosis and epithelial barrier disruption may offer insights into diarrheal disease observed in humans [
 <xref rid="B156-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. In the last few decades, multiple porcine enteric viruses that cause acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in neonatal piglets have been identified, including 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family members, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine deltacoronavirus, as well as porcine NoV similar to human NoV GII strains [

 <xref rid="B159-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. These viruses show fecalâ€“oral transmission similar to human enteric viruses, providing an opportunity to investigate the nuances of viral transmission and define factors controlling clinical outcomes [

 <xref rid="B161-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Thus, pigs have substantial potential as models to study enteric virus co-infections.
