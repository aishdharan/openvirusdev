<p>Laboratory mouse models (specific knockouts, immunodeficient, transgenic, etc.), which can be maintained free of some of these enteric pathogens, have been highly instrumental in studying enteric viral infections including pathogenesis and immune responses. Mice are easy to manipulate and can recapitulate many of the human enteric viral–host relationships [
 <xref rid="B163-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Human NoV GII.4 has been shown to replicate in a BALB/c Rag-γc-deficient mice, suggesting that some human enteric viruses may directly infect small animal models to facilitate study [
 <xref rid="B164-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>], though the further development of mice susceptible to human enteric virus infection is an important target. The discovery of murine NoV in immunodeficient mice provided the opportunity to study NoV in a natural host and contributed immensely to the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of NoV pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B169-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. While murine NoV does not cause diarrheal illness in adult mice, it was recently reported to induce diarrhea in some neonatal models [
 <xref rid="B170-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Comparably, murine RV causes both diarrhea in neonatal mouse pups and spreads among littermates [

 <xref rid="B172-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Recently, murine AstV were discovered in immunocompetent, as well as in chronically infected immunodeficient, mice [
 <xref rid="B163-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>,
 <xref rid="B173-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>,
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. These murine AstV generally cause asymptomatic infection and minimal pathology [
 <xref rid="B163-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. While natural transmission of these viruses is fecal–oral, administration of virus via alternate routes permits comparative studies and can provide useful insights into pathogenesis and antiviral mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B166-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>,
 <xref rid="B175-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Importantly, studies using murine viruses have revealed that viral strains differing by only a few amino acids may have dramatically different in vivo outcomes, in cellular tropism, duration of infection, and in interactions with the host innate and adaptive immune systems [
 <xref rid="B176-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>,
 <xref rid="B177-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>,
 <xref rid="B178-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. These observations help to inform our understanding of strain-specific differences in human viruses as well. Thus, although mouse viral models may not mirror all clinical features of human enteric infections, they are useful in identifying key determinants of viral regulation in vivo.
