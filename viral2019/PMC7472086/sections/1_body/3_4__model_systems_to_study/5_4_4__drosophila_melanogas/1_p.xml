<p>Insect models, including the fruit fly 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, can be used to study oral infection by bacterial and viral pathogens in well-characterized, fast-growing, and readily genetically-manipulatable hosts [
 <xref rid="B179-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>,
 <xref rid="B180-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>,
 <xref rid="B181-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Drosophila C virus, related to mammalian enteric picornaviruses, and Flock House Virus, a persistent RNA virus, are natural enteric viral infections in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Microbiota regulation of antiviral immunity can restrict enteric viral infections in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="B182-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>], supporting that multiple aspects of enteric viral infection in higher organisms can be effectively modeled in flies. Further, 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be infected orally by human arboviruses, permitting the exploration of both fly and human virus co-infections [
 <xref rid="B183-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Taken together, 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> has important promise as a model for enteric viral co-infections.
