<p>The nematode 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is the model organism with the most biologically simple intestine, comprised of just 20 clonal enterocytes [
 <xref rid="B181-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a number of advantages, as it has a rapid generation time and can be efficiently screened using forward- and reverse-genetic, as well as drug or small molecule screening approaches. It has been instrumental in the discovery of multiple molecular pathways, such as RNA interference [
 <xref rid="B184-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. There are several natural enteric viruses that have been recently isolated from wild-caught nematodes, including Orsay virus, facilitating the study of hostâ€“virus interactions [
 <xref rid="B185-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Further, 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> are potentially amenable to infection with non-natural nematode viruses via microinjection [
 <xref rid="B186-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is thus a potential model to identify host-pathogen interactions during enteric virus co-infections.
