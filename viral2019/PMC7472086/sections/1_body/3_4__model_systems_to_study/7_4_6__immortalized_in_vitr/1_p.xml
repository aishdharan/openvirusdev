<p>Caco-2 and HT-29 lines, derived from human colorectal adenocarcinomas, are the most widely used in vitro immortalized cell systems to study mechanisms underlying host–pathogen interactions in the intestine [
 <xref rid="B187-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>,
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. The Caco-2 cell line becomes highly polarized when subjected to optimal conditions and can thus differentiate to resemble small intestine-like cells or remain undifferentiated as large intestinal cells [
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>,
 <xref rid="B189-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. This cell line has been used to cultivate a number of enteric viruses, including human NoV [
 <xref rid="B190-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>,
 <xref rid="B191-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>], human RV [
 <xref rid="B192-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>,
 <xref rid="B193-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>] and human AstV [
 <xref rid="B194-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>,
 <xref rid="B195-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>], with some success. Interestingly, Caco-2 cells have been used to perform limited co-infection studies, revealing that mixed virus infection with AstV or enterovirus interferes with RV replication [
 <xref rid="B196-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. Much like Caco-2 cells, HT-29 cells have been employed extensively for studies of different aspects of intestinal epithelial cell biology [
 <xref rid="B197-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>,
 <xref rid="B198-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. HT-29 have been used for human AdV-40 and -41 [
 <xref rid="B199-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>] and a variety of RV studies [
 <xref rid="B200-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>,
 <xref rid="B201-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. These cell lines thus offer highly tractable systems to interrogate virus–virus co-infections in intestinal epithelial cells.
