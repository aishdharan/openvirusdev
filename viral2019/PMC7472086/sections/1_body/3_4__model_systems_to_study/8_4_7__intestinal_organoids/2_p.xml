<p>Both HIOs and HIEs are widely used to study enteric viral pathogenesis and innate immune responses in the intestinal epithelium. HIOs support the replication of clinical isolates of RV, and HIEs have been used to study host restriction and innate antiviral responses to RV [

 <xref rid="B207-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Multiple human NoV strains have been successfully cultivated in HIEs derived from human intestinal biopsies [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. HIE models have also been pivotal in investigating antiviral signaling responses to enteroviruses and coxsackieviruses [
 <xref rid="B209-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>,
 <xref rid="B210-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. HIOs and HIEs thus offer efficient systems to cultivate previously non-cultivable human enteric viruses, and thus may be powerful systems to investigate enteric virus co-infections.
