 <caption> Potential consequences of enteric viral co-infections. ( a) Co-infection of multiple viral strains in a single cell facilitates the recombination and generation of novel strains. ( b) Extracellular vesicles containing multiple virions of a single virus type, one means of co-infecting new cells. Whether co-infection with unrelated viruses could lead to co-packaging is unknown. ( c) An example of enteric viral interference, wherein murine AstV infection inhibits murine NoV infection of tuft cells via IFN-Î» production. </caption>
