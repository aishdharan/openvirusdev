  <p>Potential consequences of enteric viral co-infections. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Co-infection of multiple viral strains in a single cell facilitates the recombination and generation of novel strains. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Extracellular vesicles containing multiple virions of a single virus type, one means of co-infecting new cells. Whether co-infection with unrelated viruses could lead to co-packaging is unknown. (
   <bold>c</bold>) An example of enteric viral interference, wherein murine AstV infection inhibits murine NoV infection of tuft cells via IFN-Î» production.
