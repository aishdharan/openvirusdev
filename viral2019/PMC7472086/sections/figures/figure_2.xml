  <p>In vivo and in vitro co-infection study models. In vivo models for enteric virus studies include mouse (murine NoV, AstV, and RV), fly (Drosophila C virus, Flock House virus), pig (human RV, human NoV, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus), 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Orsay virus) and non-human primate (human RV and NoV, simian RV, and rhesus enteric caliciviruses) models with physiological experimental read-outs. In vitro models that could be used for enteric co-infection studies include organoids/enteroids and immortalized cell lines for detailed analyses in simplified systems.
