<p>The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was not known to infect humans until very recently [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It was declared a global public health emergency of international concern on January 30 and a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the first to be caused by a coronavirus [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease that has exerted a tremendous impact on public health and socioeconomic development. Confirmed cases have been reported in 196 countries, areas or territories [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As of March 25, 2020, 375,498 cases including 16,362 deaths were reported worldwide [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The first case was reported in Shanghai on January 20, 2020. By February 29, of 337 cases confirmed in Shanghai, 287 were discharged and 3 died. While COVID-19 cases in Shanghai have all been imported, we are not aware of a comprehensive analysis of the epidemiological and clinical course of primarily imported COVID-19 in a major urban centre. The Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC) is the only COVID-19 designated hospital for adult patients in Shanghai. We investigated epidemiological and clinical features, disease severity, diagnosis, treatment, clinical outcomes, and follow-up of COVID-19 in Shanghai, with the hope of assisting other large urban centres in planning for the high risk of extensive SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The effective management of this epidemic highlights the benefits of early and aggressive control measures.
