<p>Among those treated with antivirals, median times from illness onset to negative viral detection by pharyngeal swab, urine, faeces, and blood samples were 8, 8, 10, and 14 days, respectively. Median time from illness onset to negative viral detection was longer in severe and critical patients compared with mild patients (
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Median times from initiation of antiviral therapies to negative viral detection in pharyngeal swab, urine, faeces, and blood samples were 2, 2, 4, and 9 days, respectively, which were longer in severe and critical patients compared with mild patients (

Among 22 mild patients without antiviral treatment, median times from illness onset to negative viral detection in nasopharyngeal swab, urine, faeces, and blood samples were 9, 7, 10, and 9.5 days, respectively. There were no differences between patients with or without antiviral treatment in time from disease onset to viral conversion (swab,

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.832; faeces, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.401; and blood, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.057). When limiting the comparison to mild cases only, there was no evidence for any differences across sample types (Table S1 in supplementary material). However, longer duration of viral shedding was detected in patients prescribed with glucocorticoid, especially in blood and faeces (Table S2 in supplementary material). Longer duration of viral shedding was detected in blood and faeces in patients with mild disease using glucocorticoid (Table S3 in supplementary material); however, no differences in duration of viral shedding were observed in patients with severe-critical disease (Table S4 in supplementary material).
