<p>The case-fatality rate was lower (0.92%) than same day national data (3.6%) [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and consistent with a previously reported comparison of the concurrent national case fatality rate of 3.57% and 0.85% outside Wuhan [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Studies have suggested that old age and comorbidities are risk factors for death [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our cohort, 20% of patients were over 65 years old, nearly 30% had underlying disease. Case fatality rate in patients with and without glucocorticoid in the full case series was 12% and 0, respectively. As deaths only occurred in the severe-critical group, this comparison was inadequate to draw inferences on the impact of glucocorticoid use. The main cause of death was ARDS and MODS. The average hospital stay in Shanghai was 15 days was slightly longer than national average [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Risk factors for severe-critical disease and death will be examined in subsequent analyses.
