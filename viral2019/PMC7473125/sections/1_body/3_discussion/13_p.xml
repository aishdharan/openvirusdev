<p>We did not observe cases among children and pregnant women, which was consistent with studies showing a typically mild disease course among children and a lack of evidence for higher risks in pregnancy. Moreover, our research may not reflect the transmission and clinical features completely since undetected asymptomatic and mild cases may exist. Other limitations included small numbers of severe and critically ill patients for study and potential lack of representativeness of imported cases if extrapolated to urban community transmission.</p>
