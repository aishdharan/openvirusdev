<p>Most confirmed cases were reported between late January and early February 2020, with the epidemic gradually declining by the end of February. Before the Wuhan lockdown, the SPHCC had received its first confirmed COVID-19 patient. Distribution of the daily admission frequency was consistent with the timing of the Spring Festival holiday and accompanying large scale domestic population movement. Control measures taken in most provinces during the holiday and prior to return travel coincided with the acceleration of the Wuhan outbreak and subsequent lockdown on January 24th. Clinical data indicating that patients presented relatively early in their disease course, suggested that this relatively closed epidemiological system helped prevent additional case importation, while aggressive control measures appear to have interrupted the establishment of urban community transmission.</p>
