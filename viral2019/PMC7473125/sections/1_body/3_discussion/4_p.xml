<p>Abnormally elevated D-dimer levels were found in over one-third patients. Zhong et al. reported that the proportion of patients with D-dimer over 0.5 µg/ml were significantly higher in severe cases and those who met a composite endpoint i.e. admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death, compared with mild cases [
