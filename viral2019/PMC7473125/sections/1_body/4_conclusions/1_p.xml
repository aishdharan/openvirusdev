<p>This retrospective study of 325 cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai found that the epidemic was imported and transmitted within clusters. The disease typically presented as a viral pneumonia involving both lungs, with half of cases requiring oxygen therapy. Time from onset to admission and the high proportion of mild illness suggested patients presented early in their disease course. The timing of Spring Festival in relation to the Wuhan lockdown helped to limit case importation, facilitate early presentation and management of symptomatic patients, and prevent onward community transmission. Moving forward, we hope to continue to deliver early and optimal care, limit community transmission, and tying the case fatality to the lower end of the known range.</p>
