<p id="par0010">These guidelines are based on an exhaustive search of studies concerning the role of children in the transmissibility of the infection and of children's susceptibility to infection. The PubMed and medRxiv databases were searched, with a particular focus on publications from the past 3 months. The following keywords were used: children, pediatric, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, schools, transmission, susceptibility, outbreak, household. This review of recent publications was organized around four themes: (a) the role of children in transmission, (b) susceptibility to infection, (c) expression of the disease in children, and (d) the benefits of school. The established recommendations were also compared with the different positions taken by pediatric societies or governmental health organizations in Europe.</p>
