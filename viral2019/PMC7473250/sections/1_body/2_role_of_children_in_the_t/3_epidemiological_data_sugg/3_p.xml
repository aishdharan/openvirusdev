<p id="par0030">Only one recent study showed a strong pediatric transmission 
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. After exposure to a teenage staff member in a camp without any particular prevention measures, the attack rate was 51% in children aged 6–10 years and 44% in those aged 11–17 years; 26% of the infections were asymptomatic. This study gave few details on the epidemiological links, but suggested avoiding situations of very close exposure without appropriate measures. Somewhat similar to this study, an outbreak was described in a high school in Israel, during the reopening of schools, with an attack rate of 13.2% among teenagers and 16.6% among teachers 
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This study was, however, not very informative because the conditions of the outbreak were very particular (no prevention measures, heatwave, air conditioning), the modes of transmission were not described, and intrafamily screening was not reported. Like the experience of the Georgian camp, it nevertheless suggests avoiding situations of close exposure in high school without appropriate prevention measures.
