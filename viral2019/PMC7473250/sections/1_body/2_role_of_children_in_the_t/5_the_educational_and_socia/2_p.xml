It is particularly crucial to set up a rapid screening strategy around adult cases, targeting as a priority the circle of close relatives. The risk of an epidemic in a community of children will also be lower if adult staff in the establishments follow strict health measures, since transmission in communities is mainly from adults to adults or from adults to children.
