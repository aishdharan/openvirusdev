<p id="Par2">Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a member of the genus 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>, is a single-stranded, positive-sense enveloped RNA virus that causes enteritis and watery diarrhoea in pigs, especially nursing piglets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The full genome of PDCoV is approximately 25.4 kb long, which is the smallest genome size among the porcine coronaviruses, arranged in the order 5′ untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a and b (ORF1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), non-structural gene 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), non-structural gene 7 (NS7), and 3′UTR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The PDCoV S gene is frequently used for studying genetic relationships among different PDCoV strains and for performing epidemiological investigations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].
