<p id="Par4">In this study, a total of 634 intestinal and faecal clinical samples (405 intestinal samples and 229 faecal samples) were collected from pigs with diarrhoea outbreaks diagnosed by a pig farm veterinarian from January 2017 and June 2019. All samples were collected from suckling piglets and sows and from pig farm in 13 regions in Sichuan province. The sampling locations are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Soon after sampling, faeces and intestinal contents were prepared as 10% suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The suspensions were then vortexed and centrifuged at 8000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min. The clarified supernatants were stored at -80°C until use for RNA extraction. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR was carried out to assess the frequency of PDCoV monoinfections and coinfections with PEDV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). We used the virotype PEDV/TGEV/PDCoV RT-PCR Rgt (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
