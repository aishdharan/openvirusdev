<p id="Par5">Representative PDCoV strains from four different pig farms where severe or moderate diarrhoea had been reported were selected for sequencing of the complete genome by RT-PCR amplification of 24 regions covering the PDCoV genome as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These representative PDCoV strains were named CH/SC/2017, CH/SC/2018/1, CH/SC/2018, and CH/SC/2019 (GenBank accession nos. MK211169, MK005882, MK330605, and MK993519). The PCR products were purified and cloned into the vector pMD18-T. Positive clones of each amplicon was sequenced twice (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). At least three independent PCR amplicons were sequenced to obtain a consensus sequence. Complete sequences of four PDCoV strains were assembled by combining overlapping contigs and trimming off primer sequences using the DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Sequence alignment analysis of these four strains and other PDCoV strains with sequences in the GenBank database was conducted using the Megalign program. Phylogenetic trees based on complete genome and S gene sequences were constructed by the maximum-likelihood method using MEGA software version 6 with bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates.
