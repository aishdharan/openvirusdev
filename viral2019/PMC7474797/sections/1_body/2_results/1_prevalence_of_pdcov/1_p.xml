<p id="Par7">Of the 634 clinical samples tested in our PDCoV prevalence survey, 84 (13.25%) were positive for PDCoV and 204 (32.18%) were PEDV positive. The positive rate for PDCoV in sows and piglets was 6.80% (14/206) and 16.36% (70/428), respectively. All of the samples were negative for TGEV, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The results indicate that the prevalence rate of PDCoV was relatively low in diarrhoeal pigs in Sichuan and that PEDV was the main pathogen causing diarrhoea in pigs. It is also noteworthy that 47 samples that were positive for PDCoV were also positive for PEDV, showing that mixed infections with these viruses are relatively common. The PDCoV infection rates in different regions of Sichuan province are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Twelve out of the 13 regions were considered PDCoV positive, including the regions of Mianyang (14.93%), Deyang (16.67%), and Guanan (22.73%), suggesting that PDCoV is widespread on pig farms in Sichuan province.
