<p id="Par8">As shown in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, The results show that the prevalence of PDCoV in diarrhoeal pigs increased from 10.53% in 2017 to 17.24% in 2019; however, based on statistical analysis, we could not conclude that PDCoV infection in diarrhoeal pigs has been increasing from year to year (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). More clinical samples are needed to determine whether the PDCoV infection rate is correlated with the year of sample collection. Moreover, analysis of individual variables revealed that suckling piglets were 2.77 (OR) times more likely to be infected than sows. Additionally, the PDCoV positive rates in spring (15.46%, 32/207) and winter (16.22%, 36/222) were clearly higher than in summer (5.26%, 4/76). Pigs had about 3.30 (OR) times more risk of PDCoV infection in spring and winter than in summer. PDCoV/PEDV coinfection was statistically correlated with age. Coinfection was 75% less likely in sows than suckling piglets.
