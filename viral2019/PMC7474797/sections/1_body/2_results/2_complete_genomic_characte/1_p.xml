<p id="Par9">The complete genomes of four novel PDCoV strains, representative of epidemic strains, were sequenced and analysed to perform a molecular characterisation of PDCoV in Sichuan. The results showed that the complete genomic sequences of strains CH/SC/2017, CH/SC/2018/1, CH/SC/2018, and CH/SC/2019 were 25,402 nt, 25,413 nt, 25,414 nt, and 25,392 nt in length, respectively, and all had a typical PDCoV genome organisation. Sequence alignment analysis showed that the CH/SC/2017 and CH/SC/2019 strains both had an 11-nt deletion in the 3′UTR region when compared with strains CH/SC/2018 and CH/SC/2018/1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All four sequenced strains had a 6-nt deletion in the non-structural gene (ns) 2 region (ORF1ab), which has been observed in some other Chinese strains. Additionally, CH/SC/2019 had a 9-nt deletion in the ns 3 region (ORF1ab) when compared with most Chinese strains. This deletion is also present in strain CH/Sichuan/S27/2012, detected previously in Sichuan, and in strains from Thailand and Vietnam. Moreover, compared with strains from other countries, a 3-nt (TAA) deletion was observed in the S gene of the four novel strains, which is also present in most Chinese PDCoV strains, except early Chinese strains (CHN-GD and CHN-AH).
