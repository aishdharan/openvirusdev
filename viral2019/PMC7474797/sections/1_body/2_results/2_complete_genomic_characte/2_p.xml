<p id="Par10">Pairwise nucleotide sequence comparisons showed that the four sequenced strains shared 98.9%-99.3% nucleotide sequence identity with each other, and shared 97.6%-99.0% nucleotide and 98.0%-99.5% aa sequence identity with reference PDCoV sequences. Interestingly, the full genomes of the CH/SC/2017, CH/SC/2018, and CH/SC/2018/1 strains all had low nucleotide sequence identity (97.6%) to strains from Vietnam and Thailand, while the CH/SC/2019 strain shared relatively high nucleotide sequence identity (98.9%) with these strains, suggesting that the Sichuan PDCoV strains might have undergone genetic changes and continued to evolve.</p>
