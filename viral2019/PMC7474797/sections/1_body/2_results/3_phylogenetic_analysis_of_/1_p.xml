<p id="Par11">Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the whole-genome and S gene sequences of the four sequenced strains and other reference PDCoV strains (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and B. The phylogenies based on the complete genome sequences and the S gene both revealed that the PDCoV strains showed obvious regional characteristics, as has been reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences indicated that the PDCoV CH/SC/2017, CH/SC/ 2018/1, and CH/SC/ 2018 strains grouped within the Chinese clade and are more closely related to strains SHJS/SL/2016 and CH/HN/2014. However, the CH/SC/2019 strain is located in another subcluster and is similar to the CH/QH/2017 and CH/GS/2017 strains, which were isolated from piglets in recent years, suggesting that the origin of these isolates may be different.
