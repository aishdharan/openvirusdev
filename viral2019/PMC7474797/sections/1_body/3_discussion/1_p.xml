<p id="Par13">In this study, RT-PCR analysis of 634 clinical samples from pigs with diarrhoea collected from 13 regions in Sichuan province from January 2017 and June 2019 revealed a positive rate of PDCoV of 13.25%, while that of PEDV was 32.18%, indicating that PEDV is still the primary pathogen causing porcine diarrhoea, which is consistent with previous studies [

The prevalence of PDCoV in diarrhoeal pigs in Sichuan was somewhat lower than in other provinces, such as Henan (23.49%) and Guangdong (21.8%), but a molecular-based detection study showed a similar low prevalence of PDCoV infection in Jiangsu (4.94%) and Hubei (6.45%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The prevalence of PDCoV in Qinghai and Tibet is also low, with a positive rate of only 3.70% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These data show that the prevalence of PDCoV in diarrhoeal pigs differs among the Chinese provinces, and more information regarding the molecular epidemiology of PDCoV in China is needed. In this study, the number of samples collected and regions investigated was limited, and therefore more samples need to be collected and tested, and PDCoV surveillance should be continued. Also, since the aim of this study was only to monitor the prevalence of PDCoV in diarrhoeal pigs more samples, including those from pigs without diarrhoea, are needed to evaluate the prevalence of PDCoV in Sichuan pig herds.
