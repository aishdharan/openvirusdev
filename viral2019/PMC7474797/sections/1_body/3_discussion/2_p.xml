<p id="Par14">Although the overall prevalence of PDCoV in this study was relatively low, PDCoV was detected in most regions of Sichuan, implying that PDCoV prevention measures have not been very effective, and further study is needed to prevent and control this novel enteric virus. Statistical analysis demonstrated a higher chance of PDCoV infection in winter and spring, which is consistent with previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], suggesting that we should pay more attention to preventing infections during these seasons. Furthermore, we detected PDCoV in sows, as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, unlike a previous study, our results showed that suckling piglets had a 2.77 times higher risk of PDCoV infection than sows. Previous reports have suggested that older pigs are more susceptible to PDCoV than piglets, which was not confirmed by our results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, more clinical samples from older pigs are needed to test this conclusion. We plan to continue to monitor PDCoV infections in sows. Moreover, it has been reported that PDCoV/PEDV coinfection is more common in Chinese pigs than PDCoV/porcine rotavirus coinfection in US pig herds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our detection data are consistent with this, also showing that suckling piglets have a higher chance of PDCoV/PEDV coinfection.
