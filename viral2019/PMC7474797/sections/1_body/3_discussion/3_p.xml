<p id="Par15">The results of sequence analysis showed that the four strains had some unique deletions/insertions compared to other PDCoV strains. The CH/SC/2019 strain, like the CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 strain, had a 6-nt deletion in the ns 2 region and a 9-nt deletion in the ns 3 region, respectively, while the others strains only had a 6-nt deletion in ns 2. Moreover, four stains had a 3-nt deletion in the deletion of the S gene, resulting in one amino acid. This deletion exists in most Chinese PDCoV isolates. The S1 region is responsible for virus receptor binding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], suggesting that this aa deletion may have some biological significance regarding viral replication or pathogenesis. Importantly, the CH/SC/2017 and CH/SC/2019 strains had a unique 11-nt deletion in the 3′UTR region. This is the first report of a PDCoV strain with such a deletion. However, we do not know whether these naturally occurring deletions or insertions have biological significance in PDCoV biology and pathogenesis. The four sequenced PDCoV strains were all collected from suckling piglets, but the clinical signs in these piglets were different. The piglets infected with the CH/SC/2017 and CH/SC/2019 strains suffered from severe watery diarrhoea and died after three days of diarrhoea, while the suckling piglet with the CH/SC/2018 and CH/SC/2018/1 strains had moderate diarrhoea and then recovered. Were these different clinical signs associated with the 11-nt deletion in the 3′UTR or another deletion/insertion? We will continue to isolate PDCoV strains for further investigation.
