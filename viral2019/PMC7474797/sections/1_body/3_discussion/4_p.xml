<p id="Par16">A phylogenetic tree constructed based on complete genome sequences indicated that these strains might have evolved from different Chinese strains. In the phylogenetic tree based on the S gene, the Sichuan strains clustered in a different clade. The CH/SC/2017, CH/SC/2018/1, and CH/SC/2018 strains are in the China lineage, like most Chinese PDCoVs, while the CH/SC/2019 strain is in the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage. This is possibly due to recombination or separate evolution Additional PDCoV sequences are needed to identify possible recombination and evolution events.</p>
