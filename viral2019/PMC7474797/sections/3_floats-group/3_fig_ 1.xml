 <caption>
  <p>The four main deletions or insertions in the complete genome sequence alignment. A multiple sequence alignment was constructed using ClustalW in the DNASTAR software. The four PDCoV strains sequenced in this study are indicated by black triangles. A dot (•) indicates that the nucleotide exactly matches the reference sequence. A dash (-) indicates that the nucleotide is deleted relative to the reference sequence</p>
