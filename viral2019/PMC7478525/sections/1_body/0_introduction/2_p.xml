<p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that has increased 30-fold in the past 50 years due to large-scale migration of the population, the lack of adequate vaccines and effective drugs,

 </sup> It is estimated that 2.5 billion to 4 billion people live in countries or regions where dengue virus transmission, and over 70% of high-risk populations live in the Asia-Pacific region, making this region the epicenter of the global dengue epidemic.

 </sup> In addition, due to climate change, international trade, tourism, urban congestion, and vector control failures, the spread of dengue is global.

 </sup> This has caused a large economic burden on society and individuals around the world. It is estimated that the average annual total cost of dengue worldwide is estimated at $8.9 billion [95% confidence interval (95% CI): $3.7 billion–$19.7 billion], with inpatients spending about $70.10 per case (95% CI: $66.66–$74.63) and outpatients spending $51.16 per case (95% CI: $49.80–$53.71).

 </sup> The average cost of dengue in the Americas is $2.1 billion per year, compared with $950 million in Southeast Asia, which exceeds the cost of other viral diseases.
