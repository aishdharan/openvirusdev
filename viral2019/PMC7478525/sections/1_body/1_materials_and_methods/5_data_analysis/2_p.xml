<p>Dengue cases from January 1, 1990, to December 30, 2019, were included in the analysis. The crude incidence rate was estimated as the number of possible and confirmed cases divided by the number of people at the end of each year issued by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. GraphPad Prism 7 was used to generate disease evolution maps and heat maps to show epidemiological changes and occupational distribution of dengue. To compare the number of cases and deaths of dengue per month in mainland China and Guangdong Province, we also used GraphPad Prism 7 to create heat maps. Excel 2016 was used to create a cyclone map to clarify the age and gender distribution of the disease. To distinguish the spatial distribution of disease, we used Powerpoint 2016 to create geographic maps.</p>
