 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, dengue fever has been reported in mainland China every year since 1990, with an epidemic every 4 to 6 years. The number of annual dengue cases increased overall between 1990 and 2019, but there were some fluctuations. The period could be divided into the 3 time intervals: the first interval ran from 1990 to 1995, the second interval ran from 1996 to 2012, and the third interval ran from 2013 to 2019. The period from 1990 to 1995 was a steady development period, with annual dengue cases from 2 to 6836, and the incidence increased from 0.0002/100,000 (0.0002 case per one million residents) to 0.5772/100,000. The second period from 1996 to 2012 was a relatively stable period, with approximately 400 cases of dengue each year. During this period, the number of cases of dengue was high in 1999, 2002, and 2006, with more than 1000 cases per year, and the highest incidence rate was 0.1504/100,000. The period from 2013 to 2019 was a rapid development period. In 2013, there were 4663 dengue cases, which increased to 46,864 cases in 2014, and remained more than 2000 cases per year thereafter. The incidence rate also increased from 0.3444/100,000 to 3.4582/100,000, and remained above 0.14/100,000.
