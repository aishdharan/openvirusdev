<p>The spatial and temporal distribution of dengue cases in mainland China from 1990 to 2019 is shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>Â . From 1990 to 2000, dengue cases were mainly reported in the southeastern coastal areas and southwestern regions, involving 1 to 5 provinces, mainly in the southeastern coastal areas of Guangdong Province. From 2001 to 2007, the provinces reporting dengue cases each year expanded further from the southeastern coastal areas to the southwestern, central, and northeastern regions, involving 5 to 14 provinces per year, and the scope gradually increased. From 2008 to 2019, provinces reporting dengue cases each year rapidly expanded to the northwest regions, involving 16 to 27 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions, suggesting that dengue swept most of mainland China. From 1990 to 2019, only the Tibet Autonomous Region did not report dengue cases.
