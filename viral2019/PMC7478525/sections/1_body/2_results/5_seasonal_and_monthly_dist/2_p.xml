<p>In order to compare the number of cases and deaths of dengue per season and per month in mainland China and Guangdong Province from 1990 to 2019, we produced heat maps for visual analysis, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Summer and Autumn were found to be the season of large-scale epidemic of dengue fever in mainland China and Guangdong Province, especially Autumn (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Further analysis of the monthly distribution of dengue fever revealed that the prevalence of dengue fever was from June to December each year, and reached its peak from September to November (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). This phenomenon appeared once in 1995, and was more obvious from 2011 to 2019. Before 2010, there were few reports of dengue in China from January to May and December. After 2011, this phenomenon was replaced by many cases of dengue every month throughout the year. Guangdong Province has similar morbidity characteristics. The period from August to November was a high incidence of dengue in Guangdong Province, especially in September and October (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). This phenomenon was particularly evident in 2014, indicating that Guangdong Province was the major contributor of dengue cases in mainland China. Moreover, the annual dengue epidemic has gradually increased from January to October and has gradually declined from November to December. In terms of monthly distribution of dengue deaths (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E and 4F), the overall trend of Guangdong Province was highly consistent with that of mainland China, mainly in September and October, indicating that Guangdong Province was the major contributor of dengue deaths in mainland China.
