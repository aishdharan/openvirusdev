 </sup> believes that with the warming of the climate, the distribution area of the media was expands, which leads to the expansion of the distribution area of dengue. At the same time, the prevalence of dengue was caused by the general susceptibility of people in the expanded areas and the insufficient awareness of public protection. In addition, the prevalence of dengue is positively correlated with the average minimum temperature, average precipitation, average sunshine time, GDP, and population density.

 </sup> observed that the high incidence of dengue in the southwestern region was caused by trade and free marriage with a large number of foreigners. Our study also found that a total of 4 provinces reported deaths from dengue, namely Guangdong Province, Zhejiang Province, Henan Province, and Hunan Province. Among them, Guangdong Province reported the largest number of deaths in 2014, with 6 cases. This is lower than the number of 296 dengue deaths in 1988, due to the inclusion of dengue as a statutory reporting disease since 1989.
