<p>In our study, people aged 25 to 44 years were more susceptible to dengue virus infection. And most of them were male patients, especially in 25 to 34 years age group. This phenomenon was similar to India, where male patients and people between 20 and 39 years old are more susceptible to dengue fever.

 </sup> Previous studies have found that the reason for this phenomenon may be that male patients aged 25 to 34 years often travel abroad or engage in large-scale commercial and trade activities.

 </sup> Besides, dengue mainly occurs in the following groups: students, business service staffs, workers, farmers, retired staffs, housewives, and the unemployed. Wu et al

 </sup> attributed this phenomenon to the fact that most young men were engaged in business trade. Our results differ from Qinlong Jing's study, probably because he/she only screened cases of dengue that were not reported before 2014 in seven communities in Guangzhou, China.

 </sup> Students are susceptible to dengue due to group learning, outdoor activities, and insufficient immune system.

 </sup> In addition, it may be that Aedes albopictus tends to exist in small water containers around the home, while people living at home wear casually and have more skin contact, so housewives and the unemployed also suffer from a high proportion of dengue.
