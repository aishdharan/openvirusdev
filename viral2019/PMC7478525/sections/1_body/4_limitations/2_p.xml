<p>There are some limitations that cannot be ignored in this study. First, the data used came from passive public health surveillance. We were unable to obtain unreported and asymptomatic cases. Because asymptomatic infections have not been discovered and reported, the actual number of dengue fever is greater than the reported number, our study may underestimate the burden of dengue fever. Second, we were unable to obtain age, occupation, and gender data on dengue deaths. Third, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has not released data on the age, gender, and occupation of dengue fever from 2018 to 2019. Therefore, we only analyzed the data from 2010 to 2017.</p>
