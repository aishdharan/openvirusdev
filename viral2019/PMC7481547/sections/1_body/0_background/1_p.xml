<p id="Par12">Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease of swine that results in severe enteritis, diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Especially in suckling pigs, lethality can be very high [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The causative agent, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The complex coronavirus particles are pleomorphic and possess club-shaped surface projectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The length of the genome ranges from 27 to 31 kilobases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Coronaviruses have a low tenacity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] but are shed in high amounts and are thus easily transmitted by the fecal-oral route [
