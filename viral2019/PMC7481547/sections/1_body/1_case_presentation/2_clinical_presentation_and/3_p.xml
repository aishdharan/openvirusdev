<p id="Par23">In the fourth farrowing group (approx. eight weeks after the first clinical signs) no clinical signs indicative for PED were recorded and up to now no further PED suspicions arose. In autumn, five suckling piglets were randomly selected and subjected to necropsy and PED screening. All samples were negative for PEDV. In the connected fattening unit, no PED signs were recorded at any time. Serological checks in the sow rearing unit (separate building) gave negative results.</p>
