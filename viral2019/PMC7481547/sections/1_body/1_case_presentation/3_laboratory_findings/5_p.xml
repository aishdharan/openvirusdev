<p id="Par30">Comparisons between German prototype strains from 2014 (the first reported strain, BH76/14-01_L00719_Farm A) and 2019 (894_3_L03204_GER) show high similarities in the nucleotide sequence (see Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In total, 135 nucleotides exchanges are observed over the entire coding region. Of these, 64 nucleotide exchanges are located in the spike protein encoding S gene, especially in its 5′ end, and additional mutations scattered over this coding region. All sequences derived from the case farm showed 100% identity in the S gene. Compared to French and Hungarian strains reported in 2019, identities of &gt; 99.5% were found, while German strains from 2014 were app. 98.5% identical (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Highly virulent NON-INDEL strains from China and the USA were more distantly related showing identities of app. 95%.
