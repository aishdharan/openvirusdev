<p id="Par31">The RNA-shotgun sequencing approach allowed metagenomic analyses using RIEMS. In this analysis, several reads were classified taxonomically as 
 <italic>Picobirnaviridae</italic> sequences. Multiple reads of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene as well as the gene segment encoding the capsid were found in the fecal but not the intestine samples.
