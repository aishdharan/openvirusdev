<p id="Par32">Porcine epidemic diarrhea can have a tremendous impact on the pig industry as was seen in the US following the introduction of PEDV in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Critical losses occurred especially in piglet rearing companies and the losses impacted the whole pork industry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Following the devastating outbreaks on the American continent, re-emergence of PEDV was also reported from Europe after intensified surveillance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, here, strains of lower virulence were circulating and the reporting and follow-up of cases abated quickly despite ongoing cases. One reason for the subsiding of official follow-up is that PED is neither notifiable nor reportable but still has impact on trade and reputation. Against this background, most farmers had no interest to make their cases public. Thus, official and published information on the German PED situation in general and viral evolution in particular is missing roughly from 2016 onwards.
