<p id="Par35">Supplementary studies into the metagenomic data set showed picobirnaviral sequences in the fecal material. Picobirnaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded RNA viruses. They are bisegmented with segment one consisting of 2.3 to 2.6 kilobases and segment two of 1.5 to 1.9 kilobases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Picobirnaviruses are often associated with cases of gastroenteritis or infections in the respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The role in diarrhea diseases in piglets is unclear, since picobirnaviruses were found in piglets with and without diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The transmission is fecal-oral [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and these viruses have so far been detected mainly in feces in various species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Impact and relevance of these findings remains to be clarified by future studies.
