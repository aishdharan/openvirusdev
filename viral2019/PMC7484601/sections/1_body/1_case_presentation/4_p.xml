<p>To treat pneumonia, we empirically started ceftriaxone 2.0 g once daily and levofloxacin 0.4 g once daily. Reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a throat swab sample was performed on 27 January, but the result was negative for SARS-CoV-2. The Ningbo First Hospital response team decided that a second RT-PCR assay was required to exclude COVID-19. The patient was persuaded to return to the hospital and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a throat swab specimen by RT-PCR on 29 January. Therefore, her diagnosis was confirmed as COVID-19 in accordance with the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline of the National Health Committee of China.
