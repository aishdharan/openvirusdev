<p>A mechanism for COVID-19 first manifesting as gastrointestinal symptoms has been identified. A recent study showed that the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for mediating viral cell membrane and host membrane fusion during infection.

 </sup> Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to the sequence of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> On the basis of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mRNA and protein expression in normal tissue as shown in the Human Protein Atlas database (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0300060520952256">Figure 3</xref>), we speculate that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is not only expressed in lung cells, but also highly expressed in epithelial cells of the digestive tract. Therefore, the digestive system is a potential route of infection.

 </sup> This explains why gastrointestinal symptoms can be the first manifestations of COVID-19.
