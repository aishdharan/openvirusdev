<p>The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are common to many diseases. When the first manifestations of COVID-19 are gastrointestinal symptoms, the process of being diagnosed with COVID-19 is extended and patients may transmit this disease to many others while they seek treatment. Before the positive diagnosis of COVID-19, our patient had been treated at the Internal Medicine Department, Hepatological Surgery Department, Digestive Department, Respiratory Department, and fever clinic. She underwent a series of examinations, including abdominal enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, a chest CT scan, and electronic gastroscopy. Seventeen medical staff in our hospital had to be isolated for 14 days following her positive diagnosis. Fortunately, none of the medical staff were infected, which could have been a result of the strict measures applied to prevent nosocomial infection.</p>
