In a report that summarized HIV-1 diagnosis in Israel between 1981 and 2010, most HIV-1-positive women were from countries in Africa, mainly from Ethiopia. Those infected by injecting drugs or through heterosexual transmission comprised only a small minority of the reported cohort [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The characteristics of HIV-1 positive women population and the rate of transmitted resistance mutations (TDRM) in women diagnosed in more recent years have not been evaluated. The goal of this study was to profile the demographic and viral characteristics of HIV-1-positive women diagnosed between 2010 and 2018, and to estimate the proportion of women carrying HIV-1 TDRM in Israel.
