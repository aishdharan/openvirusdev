As not all treatment-naïve, HIV-1-positive women are routinely tested for resistance, the first available sample collected &lt; 6 months after initial HIV-1 diagnosis of 337 women (44.2%), selected each year by a stratified random selection design were analyzed by sequencing of HIV-1 protease (PR, codons 4–99) and reverse transcriptase (RT, codons 38–247). PR and RT TDRM were determined using the World Health Organization (WHO) consensus list of drug resistance mutations updated in 2009 [
