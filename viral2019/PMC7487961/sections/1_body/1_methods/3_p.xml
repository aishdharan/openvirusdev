<p id="Par23">Descriptive statistics was used to assess the study cohort. Variables with non-Gaussian abnormal distribution (assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) were expressed by median and interquartile range and the Kruskal Wallis test was performed to test the quality of means of several distributions. Categorical variables were expressed by frequencies and compared using chi–squared or Fisher’s exact test. The Bonferroni method was applied to check whether multiple testing could lead to the risk of type 1 errors. Logistic regression was used to test factors associated with TDRM rates. Multivariable analysis included factors found to be related (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) to the dependent variable with the forward technique covariate selection and was based on unstandardized effect-size statistics. Potential interactions were controlled by stratification on effect-measure-modifiers to assess heterogeneity of a measure across the levels of another factor. Variables with missing values (e., g missing CD4 results) were ignored. Poisson segmented regression (that typically aggregates individual-level data by time points and estimates dynamic changes over time, while adjusting for secular changes [
