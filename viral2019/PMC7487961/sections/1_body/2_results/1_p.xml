 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the baseline characteristics of HIV-1-positive women diagnosed in Israel in the years 2010–2012, 2013–2015 and 2016–2018. Median age at diagnosis was 38. Main route of HIV transmission (82.4%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 629) was sexual contact; only 10.9% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 83) were injecting drug users (IDUs). Most women were immigrants: 41.2% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 314) were born in the FSU, 32.2% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 246) in SSA and only 11.4% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 87) were born in Israel. While the total number of women identified remained stable over the study period, a significant yearly decline in the proportion of SSA immigrants versus a constant increase in women originating from the FSU was observed (
