<p id="Par26">Resistance analysis revealed that 10.4% (35/377) of women carried viruses with resistance mutations, with 7.1, 3, and 1.8% of women carrying NNRTI, NRTI and PI TDRM, respectively. While the proportion of women with NNRTI TDRM increased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017) between 2010 and 2012 and 2016–2018, paralleling a non-statistically significant increase in the overall prevalence of women with any HIV-TDRM diagnosed in these years, the rates of women with NRTI and PI TDRM remained stable. Moreover, in 2016–2018, no women with PI TDRM were identified (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All these results were further corroborated by Poisson segmented regression. No significant difference was observed in the prevalence of women with any TDRM between the different birth-places (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.170). Interestingly, the proportion of native Israeli women born in carrying a NNRTI TDRM virus (16.3%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014) was significantly higher compared its prevalence among women born in other countries (Table
