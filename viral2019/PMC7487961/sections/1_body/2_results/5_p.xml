 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> lists the type of TDRMs identified in the study cohort according to drug class. The polymorphic RT-E138 and the accessory mutation A62 sites, were also included due to their clinical relevance and high prevalence. A62V which was the most prominent NRTI mutation (5.6%, 19/337), was significantly more common in HIV-1 subtype A- as compared to HIV-1 subtype C-infected women (13%, 17/130 versus 1.4%, 2/141,

 <italic>n</italic> = 11), 4.3% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), 3% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) and 4.3% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) of subtype A, C, B and G/AG carriers, respectively. The NNRTI K103N/S mutation was identified in 4.2% (14/337) of women, and was significantly more prominent in those carrying HIV-1 subtype B compared to those carrying subtype C (11.8%, 4/34 versus 2.1%, 3/141, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.010). The most prominent PI mutation was M46I, identified in 1.5% (5/337) of patients.
