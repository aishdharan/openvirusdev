<p id="Par30">The low CD4 counts noted in this cohort of HIV-positive women, suggest late diagnosis. Moreover, women from SSA, as well as those who immigrated from the FSU, had significantly lower CD4 counts at diagnosis compared to Israeli-born women. Missed opportunities for early diagnosis has already been reported for at least 33% of the Israeli HIV population [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our data corroborate these results and highlight the need for improved HIV diagnosis policies targeting new female immigrants. These can include offering HIV testing soon after the arrival of all women immigrating from concentrated and generalized HIV epidemic regions, such as the FSU and SSA, respectively. Also, as most of the women are diagnosed at the reproductive age (median age at diagnosis was 38â€‰years), universal testing for HIV-1 infection during pregnancy should be employed, without limiting it to a selected group, e.g., immigrants from SSA, as is currently performed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It was already demonstrated that a universal approach to perinatal HIV testing achieves the best health outcomes and is cost-effective across a range of HIV-1 prevalence settings [
