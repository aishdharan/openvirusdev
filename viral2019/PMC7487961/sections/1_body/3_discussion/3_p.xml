<p id="Par31">TDRMs were identified in 10.4% of women diagnosed in the years 2010–2018. Prevalence of women with NNRTI, NRTI and PI TDRMs was 7.1, 3 and 1.8%, respectively. The proportion of women diagnosed with any TDRM and especially with NNRTI TDRMs increased significantly in more recent years, reaching 14.4 and 13.3%, respectively, among women diagnosed in 2016–2018. In a recent analysis of HIV diagnoses in 2017 in 9 European countries, the overall prevalence of resistance mutations in treatment-naïve patients was 13.5% and that of NNRTI was 7.7% [

However, the overall high rate of resistance mutations, the ongoing increase in transmission of resistant viruses, especially in more recent years, and the high rate of individuals on antiviral therapy worldwide, mandates continuous monitoring of pretreatment resistance mutations in Israel and around the world.
