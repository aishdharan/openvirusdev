<p id="Par35">The epidemiology of HIV-1-infected women in Israel is changing, showing a shift toward higher prevalence of women from FSU with subtype A HIV-1, infected through heterosexual contact. The proportion of women with any TDRM exceeded 10%, a level which, according to WHO, requires resistance testing, especially as the increase in NNRTI rates (13.3% in 2016â€“2018) seems to be ongoing. Moreover, when also considering the RT A62 and E138 polymorphic resistance-related sites, as suggested elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the overall prevalence of women with drug-resistance mutations increased to 18.4%, an alarming rate of resistance mutations. These results support the national policy of universal resistance testing soon after diagnosis and call for implementation of appropriate measures, including testing all at-risk pregnant women for HIV-1.
