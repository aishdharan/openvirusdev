<p>In December 2019, a novel virus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. Its origin has since been linked to a large seafood market involved in the illegal selling of live animals.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The virus has since rapidly spread throughout the world, and was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As of 21 June 2020 there are 8 708 008 total confirmed cases and 461 715 confirmed deaths globally.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, the actual number of cases is believed to significantly exceed reported cases due to undiagnosed asymptomatic carriers. These asymptomatic carriers as well as pre-symptomatic individuals are essential to the virus’ rapid spread with estimated infection rates of 34% and 40% according to the Centre of Disease Control.
