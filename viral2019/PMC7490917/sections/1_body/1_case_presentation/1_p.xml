<p>A 33-year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia and a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt was sent to our institution from an inpatient psychiatric facility due to concerns for the COVID-19. Per the facility, the patient had a fever and non-productive cough; however, no records accompanied the patient on arrival to our emergency department. On admission, the patient was afebrile, non-tachycardic, respiratory rate was within normal limits and his oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable except for his psychiatric examination, which showed intermittent response to internal stimuli.</p>
