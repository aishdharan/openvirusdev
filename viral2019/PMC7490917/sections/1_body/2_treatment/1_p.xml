<p>The patient was admitted under the medicine service to a COVID-positive unit requiring both airborne and contact precautions. At the time, there were two major treatment options for COVID-19: (1) hydroxychloroquine and (2) high-dose oral corticosteroids. Per hospital policy, if an individual had a positive nasopharyngeal swab and a positive chest radiograph, as our patient did, then they qualified for hydroxychloroquine therapy. Dosing was 400 mg two times the first day followed by 400 mg daily for 4 days. As he was asymptomatic, he did not qualify for corticosteroid therapy; his oxygen saturation remained at 100% on room air; therefore, no supplemental oxygen was needed during hospitalisation.</p>
