<p>The novel coronavirus is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Coronavirus family within the Betacoronavirus genus (β-CoV). It is the seventh virus of its family that has demonstrated the ability to infect humans.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3 6</xref> Rapid human-to-human transmission occurs via respiratory droplets such as coughing and sneezing. Non-respiratory viral detection in the stool, blood and semen has also been observed, but transmission capability from these sites has not been established. Infectivity begins before the onset of symptoms with an estimated mean incubation period of 5 days and basic reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) of 2.5.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 7</xref> This explains the well-known transmission of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and the exponential spread of infection.
