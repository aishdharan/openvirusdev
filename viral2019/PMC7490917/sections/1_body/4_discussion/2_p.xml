<p>The novel virus exhibits marked genetic structural similarity to members within its genus, notably Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Despite variability among amino acid sequencing, the s-protein of the viruses maintain almost identical electrostatic properties allowing COVID-19 to use the same ACE2 receptor for viral entry as SARS-CoV.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous throughout the human body, but are concentrated in the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract and systemic small vessels.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> These locations correlate with the well-established clinical symptomology of respiratory distress, diarrhoea, vasculitis and anosmia and dysgeusia. ACE2 receptors have also been found in the brain. β-CoVs, including SARS-CoV, have a well-documented propensity for neuroinvasion; thus, it is reasonable to believe COVID-19 shares this tendency.

 <italic>et al</italic> also showed that the most common coronaviruses may well survive or persist on surfaces in vitro for up to 1 month.
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These surfaces include plastic, which is the material VP shunts are made out of. Therefore, one can postulate that COVID-19 may have neuroinvasive potential based on its affinity to the ACE2 receptor, and potentially could have prolonged viral survival on the plastic of a VP shunt in vivo. This pathophysiology may explain why our patient with a VP shunt had prolonged viral shedding thus illustrating a VP shunt as a possible predisposition for prolonged viral shedding and a potential viral niche for COVID-19.
