<p>The precise duration and relationships between transmission, viral shedding and infectivity are uncertain. The length of viral shedding is variable and may depend on disease severity. In a retrospective cohort analysis of 191 patients, viral shedding ranged from 8 to 37 days with a median duration of 20 days.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Another study of 96 patients revealed a median of 21 days in patients with severe disease compared with 14 days in those with mild disease.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Additional factors associated with extended viral shedding include the male sex, delayed hospital treatment, mechanical ventilation and treatment with glucocorticoids.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The longest reported viral shedding is 60 days in a 47-year-old woman including her symptomatic course and ongoing recovery.
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> To our knowledge, our case of viral shedding for 36 days is the longest reported in a relatively young, asymptomatic patient or in a patient with a VP shunt demonstrating a VP shunt as a possible predisposition for prolonged viral shedding and possible asymptomatic infectivity. However, further studies and case reports are needed to draw this conclusion.
