<p id="par0010">We found one study each from the USA, France, and Italy. Baldi et al. considered the COVID-19 period from the first documented case in the Lombardy Region (21 February 2020−20 April 2020) and the same time frame (21 February 2019−21 April 2019, to account for the leap year) in 2019. Lai et al. considered the COVID-19 period form the first case reported in New York (March 1 to April 25, 2020) and comparing the same period (March 1 to April 25, 2019) in the previous year. While for Marijon et al. we included week 10 to week 17 from the year 2020 and 2019. The frequency of OHCA increased from 9.9, 20.8, and 15.9 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019 to 13.9, 31.7, and 47.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2020 in France, Italy, and the USA, respectively (

 <sup>2</sup>: 0.0%, p = 0.72) in patients with OHCA during the pandemic period compared to pre-pandemic.
