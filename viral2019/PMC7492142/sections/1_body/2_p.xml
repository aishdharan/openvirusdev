<p id="par0015">In this meta-analysis, we found that there were nearly two times higher odds of admissions with OHCA in the COVID-19 pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period of 2019. Existing studies suggest that patients with OHCA in 2020 were older with a high burden of hypertension, diabetes, and had physical limitations.

 </xref> A proportion of patients who suffered from OHCA in 2020 also had suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 related hyperinflammatory state leading to the high propensity of fatal arrhythmia, atherosclerotic plaque destabilization, thromboembolic state and myocardial injury could be a leading factor for OHCA in these patients. Failure to provide bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) owing to the social distancing during this pandemic period, evident from an increased rate of unwitnessed OHCA, and low frequency of shockable rhythm would have influenced the outcome in these patients.

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Unwitnessed CPR and initial non-shockable rhythms are considered markers of poor prognosis in patients with cardiac arrest. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic period has documented an increase in the rate of OHCA and OHCA-related mortality and warrants further studies to evaluate etiopathogenesis and avoid unprecedented events.
