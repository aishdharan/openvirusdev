<p id="p0025">Given a large number of infected people and mortality rates caused by the COVID-19 crisis, many countries have adopted restrictive measures to minimize the number of cases and death, yet the numbers are still increasing in some countries. The increasing number of cases and death along with the strict restrictive measures together affects people's mental health and well-being. Therefore, it is critical to identify possible modes of transmission to be equipped with efficient precaution recommendations and infection prevention guidelines to minimize infection transmission and related consequences on the quality of lives of people in future similar situations. Hence, the present paper reviews all peer-reviewed studies that reported the first cases of COVID-19 disease diagnosed in 11 countries between 05 January 2020 and 09 February 2020. Such an analysis provides a better understanding of the spreading mechanism of the virus and provides information for preparedness, early identification of cases and secondary prevention in future potential epidemics or pandemics, and contributes to improvement in the quality of lives of people across the world. The cases were divided into two categories of cases with and without travel history to Wuhan.</p>
