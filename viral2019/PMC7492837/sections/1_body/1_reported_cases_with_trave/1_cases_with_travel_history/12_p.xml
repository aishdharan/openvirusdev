<p id="p0085">Canada was another country in Americas where a 56-year-old man with non-productive cough and fever and a well-controlled hyper blood pressure visited the Emergency Department in Toronto. One day after he returned from Wuhan, a chest x-ray showed patchy bilateral, peribronchovascular, ill-defined opacities in all lung zones. Considering the clinical presentation of viral pneumonia in a patient with the appropriate epidemiological risk, the patient was admitted as a probable case of COVID-19. The results of the tests were negative for influenza virus A and influenza virus B, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. PCR showed COVID-19 in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs and sequencing confirmed the 2019-nCoV. One day after admission the patient remained well but developed mild haemoptysis and significant rhinorrhea and intermittent fever which lasted 5 days before it was completely managed. The patient discharged home and was on follow up assessments by public health workers. The authors concluded that patients with mild pneumonia who did not require supplementary oxygen and intubation could be isolated at their homes (
