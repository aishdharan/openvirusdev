The findings so far suggest that the disease starts with various initial symptoms, which is different from the original idea of manifestation of high body temperature and dry cough. It is not possible to consider a fixed set of symptoms for infected patients with the COVID-19. Further, in cases with negative nucleic acid testing and with a rapid progression of chest imaging, repeated nucleic acid testing is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Another important finding was that none of these cases developed severe symptoms. They visited the hospitals as they had seen a health alert from the governments, or they were screened mainly at borders in the airports only because they were traveling. These results highlight the critical role of the early actions of governments and authorities to have policies in place with the purpose of providing valid information for the general population and inform the world without delay and control infection spread in such crises.</p>
