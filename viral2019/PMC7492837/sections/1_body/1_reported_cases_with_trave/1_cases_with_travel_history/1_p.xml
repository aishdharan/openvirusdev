<p id="p0030">COVID-19 disease was confirmed for the first time in Yan’an in China. A 60-year-old man from Yan’an, China with a history of travel to Wuhan was the first case in the world who spread the COVID-19 virus. The patient visited the emergency department with a chief complaint of 5-day fatigue without any respiratory symptoms. On identifying his 5-day unexplained fatigue a patchy high-density shadow in both lungs was found in his chest CT scan with a negative result for the oropharyngeal swab for COVID-19 on the real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Laboratory tests revealed a slight decrease in lymphocyte count and an increase in blood levels for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The white blood cell count and D-dimer were normal. He was admitted to the department of respiratory and critical care medicine and received treatment. Five days after receiving treatments a chest CT scan showed that the dorsal part of the right upper lobe and lower lobe of both lungs developed patchy consolidation with a ground-glass-like shadow around them and grid shadows along with bronchial inflation. The second oropharyngeal swab for 2019-nCov nucleic acid test was positive 6 days after the onset of the symptoms when the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was confirmed. The patient did not develop any other clinical symptoms during hospitalization. Details of treatment and duration of the hospitalization were not reported by the authors (
