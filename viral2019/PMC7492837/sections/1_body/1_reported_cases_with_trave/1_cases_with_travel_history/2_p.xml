<p id="p0035">Nepal was one of the countries bordered with China that reported its first case of 2019-nCoV. The first infected patient with COVID-19 virus in Nepal was a 32-year man who was a university student in Wuhan, without any underlying conditions and no history of exposure to Wuhan wet market. In his return to Nepal only 10 days after he originally felt sick in China, he was visited at an outpatient department of a tropical and infectious disease hospital with a chief complaint of cough. The patient’s throat swabs were tested positive for COVID-19 on real time RT-PCR and the upper lobe of his left lung showed an infiltrate in the chest radiogram. The patient was admitted to the hospital and isolated with 37•2°C temperature and throat congestion and without any other relevant signs or symptoms. Six hours after a protocol of broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive therapies were provided for him, he had mild difficulties with breathing and decreased oxygen saturation. On the second day of his admission, he presented 38.9°C fever followed by more severe breathing difficulties in the supine position along with crepitations in the lower part of the right lung. On the third day of his admission, he did not show fever and his clinical symptoms were improved. His lab tests returned normal and he was discharged from the hospital the next day with a self-quarantine instruction at home. All laboratory tests for influenza virus type A and B, dengue viruses, Brucella and scrub typhus were negative at the discharge. His real-time RT-PCR throat swab was negative for COVID-19 on two follow up assessments. The patient was categorised as a mild COVID-19 and was recovered in 4 days (
