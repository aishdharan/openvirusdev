<p id="p0040">In Taiwan, the first case had different clinical features and developed typical symptoms related to COVID-19. A 55-year-old woman who worked in Wuhan, China without any underlying condition and exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and sick people developed a sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, and low-grade subjective fever. The symptoms were released after she used over-counter medication. After 9 days she returned to Taiwan and immediately presented to quarantine due to the history of developing symptoms. She had low-grade fever of 38.0Â°C and 88-90% oxygen saturation under ambient air in the quarantine. The next day the real-time RT-PCR throat swab resulted in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and she was admitted to hospital while she had stable vital signs except for the sore throat, intermittent dry cough and exertional dyspnea. The supplement oxygen therapy was administered by nasal cannula (3Litre/minute). The lab investigation showed lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The results of a chest X-ray showed bilateral perihilar infiltration and ill-defined patchy opacities. On the first days of hospitalization, the patient received antitussive agent, saline infusion and empiric antibiotic with ceftriaxone (2 gm everyday intravenously and 2 gm loading) followed by oral amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg every 12 h on the 8th day of admission to hospital. One week later her real-time RT-PCR of sputum specimens yielded negative results and remained negative 6 days later and serial X-ray and chest CT scan revealed tenacious COVID-19 pneumonia and sequelae. The patient discharged on the 28th day of the illness after 17 days of hospitalization when the results of the tests returned negative for SARS-CoV-2 (
