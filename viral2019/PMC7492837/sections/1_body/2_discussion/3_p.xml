<p id="p0115">One key factor in controlling the spread of the virus might be using reliable screening strategies in the borders. One of the methods was used in the past months since the pandemic started was measuring body temperature. The results of this review demonstrated that fever was not a definite indicator for diagnosing patients with CoVID-19 as several cases did not develop a fever. The main clinical presentation of most of the reported cases was lower respiratory presentation such as caught, sore throat, and dyspnea, and lung infiltration in CT scan evaluation. In addition, mild cases did not display signs and symptoms except for flu-like symptoms. Missing these cases at the borders is most likely resulting in more infected cases in the communities.</p>
