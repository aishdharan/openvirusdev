<p id="p0120">Regarding the mild cases, it is possible that the mild symptoms particularly the ones which are not accompanied by shortness of breathing might not be taken seriously by the infected cases. These symptoms might be considered as a common cold or flu by them, while they live their normal daily routine and spread the virus in the communities. One possible strategy is providing people with early public health warnings about the outbreak and the possible early symptoms of the disease. Employing such a strategy also helps authorities in controlling the spread of the virus. One reason that the health authorities were not able to control the disease in a timely manner could be that some countries did not provide valid and timely information to the WHO. Therefore, having some regulation in place by the WHO can be an efficient strategy to ensure all health authorities across the world comply with the regulation and provide them with timely information about emerging deadly diseases. Developing such regulation is a pressing need for future similar situations to prevent entering a pandemic phase from an epidemic phase.</p>
