<p id="p0130">Another critical level of controlling an infectious disease might be early identification and isolation of the new cases or instructing them for quarantine at home. The reported cases presented to the designated hospitals or clinics 5-9 days after the onset of their symptoms. This suggests that before attending the health clinics several individuals in the community were already infected by these new cases that still were not aware of their condition and attended various places around their cities, countries and most importantly other countries and committed to the transmission of the disease. What is important is the prevention of infection, which can be achieved to some extent by knowing how the early cases are infected. In fact, prevention is better than cure. There are many different treatments for COVID-19 today (

One interesting finding of this review was that early detection of pneumonia without clinical features may stop the development of severe pneumonia and admission to the intensive care unit. Thus, rapid diagnostic strategies ensure decreasing the spread of disease. To do so the health authorities will need to focus on clinical research for rapid, cost-effective and simple screening of pneumonia for similar future crises.
