<p>Since December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a serious epidemic in China and other countries. Phylogenetic analyses of the coronavirus genomes revealed that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus, a class of positive-sense, ssRNA viruses that can cause respiratory, intestinal, liver and nervous system infections in animals and humans [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane) and N (nucleocapsid) proteins, and possesses 82% identity to SARS-CoV and 50% identity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) based on genome sequencing [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, it spreads by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have a mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24–3.58 [
