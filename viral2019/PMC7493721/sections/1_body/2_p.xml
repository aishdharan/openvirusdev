<p>A previous study showed a positive RT-PCR test on throat swabs of patients recovered from COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], leading to conflicts with current criteria [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Here, we reported clinically cured cases with only positive results in anal swabs, which conflicts with current criteria for releasing people from quarantine, and further investigated the clinical value of anal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We propose anal swabs as the potentially optimal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection for evaluation of hospital discharge of COVID-19 patients.
