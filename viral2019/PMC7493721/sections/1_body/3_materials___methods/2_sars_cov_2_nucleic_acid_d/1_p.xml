<p>RNA was extracted with protease K-magnetic beads (BioPerfectus Technologies, Jiangsu, China). Then, the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were amplified by targeting three genes (
 <italic>ORF1ab, N</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic> genes) (Liferiver Bio-Tech, China). The RT-PCR assay was performed on a 7500 thermal cycler (ABI, US) under the following conditions: 50°C for 10 min for the reverse transcription reaction, initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, followed by extension and capture of the fluorescence signal at 55°C for 40 s. Both internal and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests.
