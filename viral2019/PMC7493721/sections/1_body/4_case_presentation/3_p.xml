<p>To determine whether the abovementioned patients could discontinue quarantine, throat, sputum and anal swab samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection at 2 weeks after quarantine. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 detection was positive in the anal swab of two patients and negative in throat swab and sputum samples. RT-PCR was performed again for all patients the following day, and positive detection was confirmed, including in the 3-year old boy (
