<p>Molecular detection remains the gold standard for diagnosis. As a recommended method, RT-PCR is widely used to detect SARS-CoV-2. To date, throat, sputum and anal swabs have been considered applicable for RT-PCR detection. Evidence has shown that sample type plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 detection. Viral RNA can be easily detected in nasopharyngeal, sputum and stool specimens [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the highest positivity rates were detected in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear.
