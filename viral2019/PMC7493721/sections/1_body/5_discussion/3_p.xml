<p>As the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the key for SARS-CoV to enter target cells during the course of viral infection [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref>]. Expression of ACE2 protein in human organs showed that ACE2 is most abundantly expressed on the surface of alveolar epithelial cells and small intestine epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which are involved in the progression of pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Intriguingly, a connection may exist between the lungs and GI tract [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and SARS-CoV-2 may be shed through multiple routes in the different phases of viral infection.
