<p>In this study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 detection was positive in anal swabs but negative in other sample types of a few cured patients, which challenges the current standards for discharge and termination of compulsory isolation for COVID-19 patients. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], intestinal infection was observed in the later stages of infection, indicating that the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive tract was later than that in the respiratory tract. In particular, gastrointestinal symptoms were found in children with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the burden of novel coronavirus infections is still underestimated; only approximately 1% of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases involve children according to the current estimates [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], so more biological samples and methods (e.g., serologic detection) for SARS-CoV-2 infection in children must be studied. Notably, live SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from fecal samples in threeÂ of 11 adult patients [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, anal swabs might be the optimal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection to evaluate hospital discharge of COVID-19 patients. Patients with positive stool results require further isolation until the virus is completely eliminated.
