<p>Based on the knowledge about this specific viral infection and considering the prolonged viral RNA detection in anal swabs [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressing to a severe symptom stage [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we proposed the potential infection course of SARS-CoV-2 as follows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>): upper respiratory infection (mainly by respiratory droplets); lower respiratory infection (mainly presented as pulmonary infection); viremia formation; and transmission to other organs (including the GI tract) and colonization via ACE2. Therefore, different sample types should be chosen for SARS-CoV-2 detection in various infection phases. Fortunately, Sethuraman 
 <italic>et al.</italic> devised a clinically useful timeline of diagnostic markers for the detection of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
