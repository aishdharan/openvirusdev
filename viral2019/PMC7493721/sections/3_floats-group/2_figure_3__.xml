  <title>Potential infection course of SARS-CoV-2 and the different specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection.</title>
  <p>First, SARS-CoV-2 infects the upper respiratory system mainly by respiratory droplets (asymptomatic or fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia and dyspnoea; high positive RT-PCR results in throat swabs). Subsequently, it infects the lower respiratory tract and massively replicates (mainly presented as pulmonary infection; high positive results of RT-PCR in throat swabs and sputum). Furthermore, virus is released into blood, leading to the formation of viremia (low copy number detected in blood by RT-PCR). Finally, it is transmitted to other organs, including the GI tract, and colonizes via ACE2 (higher positive detection rate in anal swabs).</p>
  <p>ACE2: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; GI : Gastrointestinal; RT-PCR: Reverse transcriptase-PCR.</p>
