  <bold>Diagrammatic summary of phenothiazine derivatives antiviral activity.</bold> All of the phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine) possess antiviral activity towards RNA viruses. These drugs inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis, cell-cell fusion, infection, replication of the virus, decrease viral invasion as well as suppress entry into the host cells.
