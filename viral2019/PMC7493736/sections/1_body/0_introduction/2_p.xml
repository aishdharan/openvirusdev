 <sub>2</sub> and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (α
 <sub>2</sub>). Noteworthy, the effect with D
 <sub>2</sub> and α
 <sub>1</sub> are associated with side effects such as extrapyramidal side-effects (akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions) and sympatholytic side-effects (hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, dizziness, myosis, sexual dysfunction) (
