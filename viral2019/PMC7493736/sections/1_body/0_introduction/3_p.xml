<p id="p0030">Viral infections still represent a major global public health problem. Up to date, antiviral drugs are used only for treating less than 10 viral infections. Unfortunately, there are still no effective enough drugs against some pathogenic viruses, for example, Zika (ZIKV), Ebola (EBOV), or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The drugs are intended to be safe for human use, as most of the targeted viral proteins are not present in humans, except the viral polymerase which is partly similar to their human counterparts. On the other hand, proteins of different species or even genotypes of virus not often share structural similarity, as well as the ability of viruses to mutate during replication cause that the antiviral drug which targets a specific viral protein is not always effective against another virus. Noteworthy, there is a lack of effective antiviral drugs on the market (

Based on the type of RNA molecule there are 3 types of RNA viruses: single-stranded (ss) RNA, double-stranded (ds) RNA, and circular RNA (circRNA). Additionally, ssRNA viruses can be classified based on the sense of nucleic acid (plus (+) and minus (âˆ’)) (
