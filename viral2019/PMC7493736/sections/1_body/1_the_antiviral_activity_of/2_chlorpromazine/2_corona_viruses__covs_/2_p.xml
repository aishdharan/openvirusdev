The viruses have one among the largest single positive-stranded RNA genome (size range between 26.2 and 31.7 kb, positive sense) from all the RNA viruses, which is covered by an enveloped structure. Because genetic material of the virus is susceptible of frequent mutations, it may form new strains with alteration in virulence - up till now 7 strains of human CoVs: 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) are known. Only 3 from 7 strains have been found to have highly pathogenic (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV). 4 strains (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) are known as non-severe (SARS)-like coronaviruses (

S proteins play a vital role in membrane penetration, and together with E and M proteins is a part of the viral membrane. S protein is responsible for receptor-binding and in consequence entering host cells, making it a potential target for therapeutic purposes. The M and E proteins are responsible for virus envelope construction, and the N protein plays a role in RNA synthesis. The predominant receptors are human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26), respectively for SARS and MERS-CoV (
