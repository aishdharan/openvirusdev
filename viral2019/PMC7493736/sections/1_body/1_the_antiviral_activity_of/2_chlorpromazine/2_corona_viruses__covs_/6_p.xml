 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chikuma et al. (1987)</xref> showed that chlorpromazine increase PZ-peptidase and collagenase-like peptidase activity, and the strength of the effect was highly dose-dependent with no influence on leucine aminopeptidase and post-proline cleaving enzyme activities in the osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, the drug in the concentration of 10 μg/ml enhanced the activity of PZ-peptidase, collagenase-like peptidase, and dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase for 72 h after treatment, which is involved in collagen degradation. Besides, the drug specifically inhibits collagen synthesis in clonal osteoblasts (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chikuma et al., 1987</xref>). Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 interacts with the MERS-CoV spike protein, therefore the ability of chlorpromazine to increase dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase activity is not a desirable characteristic for MERS-CoV treatment. Despite this fact, it can not be rolled out that the drug is not useless in MERS-CoV treatment.
