<p id="p0095">The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are flaviviruses, which has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (size about 11 kB long) and 50 nm virion size (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Filgueira and Lannes, 2019</xref>). The WNV genome encodes structural and nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) which are very important for intracellular virus replication (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chu and Ng, 2004</xref>). The target protein for ZIKV is MTase (N-terminal of NS5) (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dinesh et al., 2020</xref>). DENV NS5 was found in the infected cell nucleus. Therefore, NS5 nuclear localization is essential for infection. It has been reported for DENV, WNV, and ZIKV. The role of NS5 has the potential to suppress the antiviral response, as it can impact mRNA splicing (
