 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chu and Ng (2004)</xref>. In the case of WNV chlorpromazine inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway by accumulating clathrin and Adaptor Protein Complex-2 (AP-2) in endosomal compartments, what prevents clathrin-coated pits formation. Moreover, the effect of clathrin-mediated endocytosis-disrupting drugs on WNV entry showed a time-dependent increase antigen formulation (
