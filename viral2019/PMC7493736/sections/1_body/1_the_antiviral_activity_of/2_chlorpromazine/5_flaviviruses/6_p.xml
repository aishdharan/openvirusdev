<p id="p0115">Moreover, chlorpromazine did not influence JEV bounding but stoped its transportation into endosomes. Noteworthy, the inhibition of JEV binding to Vero cells was not observed in the concentration range 2–5 to 20 μg/ml (data were not shown by the Authors). Furthermore, the Authors showed that chlorpromazine in the concentration of 10 μg/ml affects the distribution of clathrin within a cell and inhibits the uptake of JEV in Vero cells with no influence on progeny viral protein when the infection was established if the drug was present at an early stage of infection.
