<p id="p0125">The Ebola virus is a part of the 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic> family with a single negative-sensed RNA genome (size 19 Kb). 7 proteins with multiple morphological forms can be found in the virus (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>). The virus uses the virus-like particle (VLP) expressing EBOV glycoprotein (GP
 <sub>1,2</sub>) and containing a β-lactamase (BlaM) for entering into host cells, which makes them an interesting target for antiviral therapy (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Johansen et al., 2015</xref>). 5 different species of EBOV have been identified (EBOV-Z, EBOV-S, EBOVIC, EBOV-B, and Reston ebolavirus). Noteworthy, the virulence of each species may differ markedly from the others (
