 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya et al. (2010)</xref>. The Authors showed the ability of the drug for significant inhibition of replication-competent EBOV infection - chlorpromazine in the concentration of 10 μg/ml inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the analysis of EBOV envelope glycoprotein (EbGP) infectivity in HMEC, HeLa, Vero, and 293T cell lines suggests that the observed inhibition after chlorpromazine treatment is not restricted to cell type but is present in different cell types. Furthermore, the effect of chlorpromazine on GFP-expressing replication-competent EBOV Zaire (ZEBOV-GFP) showed dose-dependent infections decrease with complete inhibition at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Interestingly, the analysis of the infection potential of ZEBOV-GFP in HeLa cells and Vero-E6 cells showed that the inhibitory effect of chlorpromazine on EBOV was not restricted to Vero-E6 cells (
