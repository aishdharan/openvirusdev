<p id="p0140">The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus is an enveloped Alphacoronavirus, which has 28Â kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The PEDV genome like Coronaviruses also encodes four key viral structural proteins (S, E, M, and N). The glycoprotein S is responsible for PEDV binding to host receptors and triggering virus-host membrane fusion. The structural proteins M and E are responsible for the construction of envelopes, while N protein is multifunctional and is involved among others in viral replication. The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causing high mortality rates in newborn pigs, may lead to high economic losses in the pork industry (
