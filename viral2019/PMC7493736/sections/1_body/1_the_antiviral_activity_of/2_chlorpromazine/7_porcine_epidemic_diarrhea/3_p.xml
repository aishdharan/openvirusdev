 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2020)</xref> analyzed the impact of chlorpromazine on the infection of alphacoronavirus - porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The cytotoxicity results showed that the concentration of 30 μM and 50 μM did not affect the viability of the Vero and the IPEC-J2 cells, respectively. The qRT-PCR results showed a significant decrease of PEDV invasion after chlorpromazine treatment (10 and 30 μM for Vero cells as well as 30 and 50 μM for IPEC-J2 cells). Moreover, chlorpromazine pre-treatment (to prevent clathrin assembly and further block clathrin-mediated endocytosis) and siRNA-mediated knockdown of clathrin heavy chain as well as EPS 15 (the critical component of clathrin-coated pits by interacting with adaptor protein 2) significantly reduce the invasion rate of PEDV into cells (
