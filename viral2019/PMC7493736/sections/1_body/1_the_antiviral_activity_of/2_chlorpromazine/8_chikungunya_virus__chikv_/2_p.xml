<p id="p0150">The Chikungunya virus is enveloped alphavirus with a diameter of 60–70 nm and a single-stranded, positive-sense, linear RNA genome. CHIKV genome contains 2 open reading frames (ORF). The first one encodes the non-structural proteins (nsP1, 2, 3, and 4), while the next one is responsible for the structural proteins (capsid, E3, E2,6K, and E1). Nonstructural proteins make up 2/3 of the genome, while structural proteins 1/3 of it. E3 proteins carry a signal peptide and are important for targeting the structural polyprotein for initial processing. E3 is also very important for the stabilization and maturation of the E2 glycoprotein, which is a key receptor binding protein for CHIKV. The E1 protein is a class II viral fusion protein mediating the fusion of the virus outermost layer with the host endosome after endocytosis, what release of the nucleocapsid. Moreover, E1, E2, and E3 proteins can be potential targets in new CHIKV therapy (
