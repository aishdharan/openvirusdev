<p id="p0160">Inhibition of Semliki Forest virus entry by chlorpromazine was analyzed by 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Pohjala et al. (2011)</xref>. The obtained results showed that the drug IC
 <sub>50</sub> for SFV replication is 15.7 μM, while IC
 <sub>50</sub> for BHK cell viability is 67.3 μM using reporter gene Renilla luciferase, 
 <italic>Rluc</italic> screening assay as an analysis method. Moreover, the drug decreased 
 <italic>Rluc</italic> activity and inhibited Chikungunya virus-
 <italic>Rluc</italic> (CHIKV-
 <italic>Rluc</italic>) infection (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 39.4 μM), and do not influence CHIKV replicon formation. It suggests that chlorpromazine can decrease entry and replication of the alphavirus and that SFV is a safe model for anti-CHIKV screening (
