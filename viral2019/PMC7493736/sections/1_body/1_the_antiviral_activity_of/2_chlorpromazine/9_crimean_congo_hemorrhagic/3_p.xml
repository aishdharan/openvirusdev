 <italic>In vitro</italic>, anti-Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic virus efficacy of chlorpromazine was analyzed by 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ferraris et al. (2015)</xref>. The drug inhibited CCHFV strains 86–07 and 87–07 and the obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 10.6 ± 0.031 and 15.8 ± 0.051 μM for 86–07 and 87–07 using Vero E6 cells, respectively. In the case of 87–07 and Huh7 cells, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 4.3 μM. It suggests that the drug was more effective towards Huh7 than in Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, the caveolae-1 pathway of Huh7 cells was missing, which strongly suggests the involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, chlorpromazine possesses the antiviral effect when it is used as pre-treatment, during the infection, or post-infection (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.3 ± 0.008, 6.7 ± 0.002, and 8.5 ± 0.004 μM, respectively for pre-treatment, concurrent and permanent conditions). Moreover, a significant synergistic antiviral activity after the ribavirin/chlorpromazine combination treatment was observed (
