 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pillaiyar et al., 2020</xref>). As in the case of chlorpromazine, the antiviral activity of fluphenazine was analyzed by 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dyall et al. (2014)</xref>. The obtained EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 5.87 and 21.43 μM for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively (

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., (2015)</xref> showed that fluphenazine moderate inhibits MERS-CoV protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was about 29 μM. It suggests that the inhibitor of the ABL-1 pathway interesting material for new antivirus drugs since the pathway is crucial for viral replication. Moreover, the drug inhibits MERS-CoV replication (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.86 μM) and cell-cell fusion stronger than chlorpromazine as well as disrupts clathrin-mediated endocytosis (

 <sub>50</sub> values of fluphenazine inhibiting cell-cell fusion and clathrin-mediated endocytosis were shown in
