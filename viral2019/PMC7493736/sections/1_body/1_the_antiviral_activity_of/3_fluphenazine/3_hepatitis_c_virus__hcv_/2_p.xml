 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gastaminza et al., (2010)</xref> based on NCC library compounds showed that fluphenazine caused a reduction in HCV infection (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.5 ± 0.2 μM, LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.5 ± 5.5 μM) as well as inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gastaminza et al., 2010</xref>). Fluphenazine as chlorpromazine is a cationic amphiphilic drug, which inhibits HCV entry at virus-host cell fusion (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dyall et al., 2017</xref>). The anti-HCV activity of fluphenazine was also analyzed by 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chamoun-Emanuelli et al. (2013)</xref>. The obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 0.37 ± 0.01 μM and a therapeutic index (CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was 15.3. Fluphenazine the most significant inhibits a post attachment step of HCV entry after adding the temperature shift to 37 °C even after CD81 antibody inactivation, which suggests, that the point of action is independent of CD81 binding, probably during a fusion stage. Moreover, fluphenazine exhibits the strongest fusion inhibition of HCVpp-liposome

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chamoun-Emanuelli et al., 2013</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Banda et al. (2019)</xref> showed that fluphenazine inhibits GT2-derived viral strains what seems to be linked with the regulation of the fusion that is related to their E1 protein properties (
