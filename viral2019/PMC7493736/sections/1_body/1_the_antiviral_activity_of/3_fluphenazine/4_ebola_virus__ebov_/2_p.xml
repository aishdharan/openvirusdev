 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Johansen et al. (2015)</xref>. The concentration of fluphenazine which caused 50% inhibition of host viability (without virus) were 5.54 ± 0.19 and 3.05 ± 1.68 μM for uninfected Vero E6 and HepG2 host cells, respectively. Interestingly, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value for viral infection was not calculated. The Authors also showed that the fluphenazine concentration of 10 μM strongly (&gt;90%) inhibits EBOV-VLP entry into SNB19 cells (
