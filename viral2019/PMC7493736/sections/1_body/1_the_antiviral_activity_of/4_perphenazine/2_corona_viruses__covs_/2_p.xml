<p id="p0190">Coronavirus key enzyme for replication is the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>), which highly similar in sequences and 3D structures in this family. Thus, the main protease is considered as an attractive target for the design of anti-coronaviral drugs. Based on the DrugBank database, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Wang (2020)</xref> identified perphenazine as the 1 from 10 commercial medicines as a potential inhibitor of 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>, which can bind the pocket site of the virus. As the Authors suggest the drug can form two hydrogen bonds with Asn28 and Asn119, which makes it theoretically “capable to bind to the pocket formed by these amino acids and interfere with the function of 2019-nCoV M
