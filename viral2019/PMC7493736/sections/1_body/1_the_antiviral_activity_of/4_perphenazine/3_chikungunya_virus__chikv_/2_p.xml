<p id="p0200">Inhibition of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) entry also by perphenazine was analyzed by 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Pohjala et al. (2011)</xref>. The obtained results showed that the drug IC
 <sub>50</sub> for SFV replication is 25.1 μM, while IC
 <sub>50</sub> for BHK cell viability is 155.0 μM using reporter gene Renilla luciferase, 
 <italic>Rluc</italic> screening assay. Moreover, the drug decreased 
 <italic>Rluc</italic> activity and inhibited Chikungunya virus-
 <italic>Rluc</italic> (CHIKV-
 <italic>Rluc</italic>) infection (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 48.1 μM), and did not influence CHIKV replicon formation. It suggests that perphenazine can decrease entry and replication of the alphavirus and that SFV is a safe model for anti-CHIKV screening (
