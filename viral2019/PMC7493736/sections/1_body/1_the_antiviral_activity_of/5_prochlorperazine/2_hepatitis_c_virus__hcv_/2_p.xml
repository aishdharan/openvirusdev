 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gastaminza et al., (2010)</xref> based on NCC library compounds showed that prochlorperazine like fluphenazine cause a reduction in HCV infection (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.3 ± 0.7 μM, LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 29.3 ± 12.3 μM) as well as inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chamoun-Emanuelli et al. (2013)</xref>. The obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 0.92 ± 0.11 μM and a therapeutic index (CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was 8.3. Infectivity of HCVcc samples pretreated with prochlorperazine was also as in the case of fluphenazine similar to the control (non-pretreated) results what suggests that the drug does not inhibit HCV entry with direct inactivation (
