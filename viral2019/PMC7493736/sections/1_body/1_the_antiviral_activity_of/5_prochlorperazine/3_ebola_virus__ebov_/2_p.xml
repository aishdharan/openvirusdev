 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Johansesn et al. (2015)</xref>. The concentration of the drug which caused 50% inhibition of host viability (without virus) were 5.96 ± 0.42 and 3.59 ± 0.19 μM for Vero E6 and HepG2 host cells, respectively. Interestingly the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value for viral infection was not calculated. The Authors also showed that the prochlorperazine concentration of 10 μM strongly (&gt;90%) inhibits EBOV-VLP entry into SNB19 cells (
