<p id="p0225">Noteworthy, potential inhibitors of the NS3 protein of ZIKV were analyzed by 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Sahoo et al. (2016)</xref>. The Authors showed that prochlorperazine can bind the NS3 protein of ZIKV and DENV. In the case of ZIKV, the binding energy is -5.5 kcal/mol and the H-bond interaction is possible by the Tyr161, while in the case of DENV the binding energy is -6.0 kcal/mol and the H-bond interaction was not observed (
