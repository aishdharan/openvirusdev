<p id="p0230">As in the case of fluphenazine and prochlorperazine, antiviral activity towards the EBOV of thioridazine was also analyzed by 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Johansesn et al. (2015)</xref>. The concentration of the drug which caused 50% inhibition of host viability (without virus) were 6.24 ± 0.79 and 2.06 ± 0.12 μM for Vero E6 and HepG2 host cells, respectively. In opposite to fluphenazine and prochlorperazine, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value for viral infection was 10.2 ± 9.06 and 21.6 ± 0.78 μM for Vero E6 and HepG2 host cells, respectively. The Authors also showed that the thioridazine concentration of 10 μM strongly (&gt;90%) inhibits EBOV-VLP entry into SNB19 cells [45]. According to the table published by 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lee et. Al (2018)</xref> thioridazine possess anti-EBOV activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.45 ± 0.26 μM [57].
