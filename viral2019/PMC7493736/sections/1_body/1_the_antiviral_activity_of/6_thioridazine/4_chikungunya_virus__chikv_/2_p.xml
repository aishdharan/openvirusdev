<p id="p0240">Inhibition of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) entry also by thioridazine was analyzed by 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Pohjala et al. (2011)</xref>. The obtained results showed that the drug IC
 <sub>50</sub> for SFV replication is 14.9 μM and 19.3 μM, while IC
 <sub>50</sub> for BHK cell viability is 179.4 μM, respectively to the analysis method (reporter gene Renilla luciferase, 
 <italic>Rluc</italic> screening assay or CPE reduction and virus production assays). In the case of Sindbis virus (SINV) the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of viral replication is 37.3 μM using CPE reduction. Moreover, the drug decreased 
 <italic>Rluc</italic> activity, inhibited Chikungunya virus-
 <italic>Rluc</italic> (CHIKV-
 <italic>Rluc</italic>) infection (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 71.5 μM), and had no influence on CHIKV replicon formation. It suggests that thioridazine can decrease entry and replication of the alphavirus and that SFV is a safe model for anti-CHIKV screening (
