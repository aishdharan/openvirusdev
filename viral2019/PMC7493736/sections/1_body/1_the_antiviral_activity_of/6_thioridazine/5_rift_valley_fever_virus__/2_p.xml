<p id="p0245">The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a 
 <italic>Phlebovirus,</italic> with RNA, which can be divided into three fragments. Large (L) responsible for RNA polymerase, medium (M) encodes structural glycoproteins Gn and Gc (mediate binding and entry via receptors), and small (S) responsible for nucleoprotein of the single-stranded RNA genome. The structural glycoproteins play a crucial role in virus entry to the cell. The 78-kDa glycoprotein is able to form a complex with the Gc glycoprotein and may constitute a target for the immune system. The RVFV causes zoonotic disease affecting both ruminants and humans, which is endemic to the African continent and occurs also in the Middle East (
