<p id="p0295">The link between the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-viral effect of prochlorperazine suggests that the drug in a therapeutic concentration can achieve an antiviral effect towards DENV and that phenothiazines can be repurposed from an antipsychotic drug to an anti-viral drug. Moreover, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> results suggest that chlorpromazine may be potentially used in the anti-HCV and CCHFV therapy, but it is not efficient in CCHFV treatment since inhibition of viral binding to the Vero cells was not observed. On the other hand prochlorperazine role in HCV treatment is debatable, as the drug is not effective in ZIKV treatment, but it is very promising in DENV treatment. Thus, further investigations are needed to determine the fragments in phenothiazines responsible for the antiviral effect.
