<p id="p0265">All the researcher groups which analyzed the antiviral activity of chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine observed decrease viability of host cells after treatment. The summarized IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the analyzed drugs towards different types of viruses were shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> . In case of chlorpromazine towards MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E-GFP, prochlorperazine towards HCV, and thioridazine towards HCV and EBOV the obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values are lower than the upper range of toxic concentration observed in human plasma, which is up to 2 μg/ml (i.e. 5.63 μM), 0.1 μg/ml (i.e. 0.20 μM), 1 μg/ml (i.e. 2.47 μM), 1 μg/ml (i.e.1.65 μM), and 5 μg/ml (i.e.12.28 μM) for chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, and prochlorperazine, and thioridazine respectively (
