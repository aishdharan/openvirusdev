 <sub>50</sub> values obtained by 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gastaminza et al. (2010)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chamoun-Emanuelli et al. (2013)</xref> suggest that fluphenazine is about 2.5 times more efficient towards HCV than prochlorperazine, but the concentration of prochlorperazine is in the range of human plasma concentration. Moreover, the drug is more effective in HCV treatment than chlorpromazine, but much less effective than fluphenazine. The most promising are results obtained by 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Simanjuntak et al. (2015)</xref> which showed that prochlorperazine in nM concentration inhibits protein expression, viral progeny, replication of DENV-2. The drug also reduces infection of DENV-1, DENV-2, and Japanese encephalitis virus as well as inhibits DENV entry through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Simanjuntak et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> results suggest that the concentration which protected the animals against death caused by DENV-2 can obtain since it is similar to the dose used in nausea and vomiting prevent and/or treating. On the other hand, prochlorperazine is not effective in ZIKV treatment (
