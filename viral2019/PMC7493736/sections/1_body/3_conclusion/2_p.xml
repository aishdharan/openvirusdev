<p id="p0300">Chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine possess anti-viral activity towards different types of viruses. These drugs inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis, cell-cell fusion, infection, replication of the virus, decrease viral invasion as well as suppress entry into the host cells. The drugs display activity at nontoxic concentrations and may have the potential for therapeutic use. Moreover, the animal 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that the antiviral activity of prochlorperazine can be effective in the therapeutic concentration. Despite 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antipsychotic drugs may lead to side effects. Thus, many experiments are important to precise the molecular mechanism for antiviral effects of phenothiazines and reduce a concentration to reasonable dose and/or generate derivatives to diminish the side effects of antiviral therapy.
