<p id="para40">Across these countries, doctors consistently cited the patient's fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at clinics as a primary reason for the drop in patient numbers. The decrease in number of outpatient visits seems to have started in February, 2020, preceding confirmation of the first COVID-19 cases in these countries (from the second to third week of March, 2020) and implementation of public health measures limiting social contacts by the respective governments (in March and April, 2020). In Burkina Faso, the number of patients regularly monitored for chronic viral hepatitis steadily fell over this period, even though clinics were maintained and treating doctors encouraged patients to be retained in care. By contrast, in Tanzania and The Gambia, hepatitis clinics were temporarily closed at the end of March, 2020, to prepare for the COVID-19 epidemic, and staff at hepatitis services were relocated to support COVID-19 preparedness, to receive patients who were febrile with a suspicion of COVID-19, and to mitigate COVID-19 outbreaks. Of the essential diagnostic tests to manage chronic hepatitis, rapid tests for HBsAg, alanine aminotransferase, and haematology were available without any disruption throughout this period in these countries. However, there was a severe shortage of nucleic acid tests for HBV DNA or HCV RNA. Moreover, in Burkina Faso, direct-acting antivirals for HCV were temporarily unavailable because of disrupted supply secondary to suspension of international flights. Nevertheless, during this period, none of the doctors surveyed witnessed a health-care system collapse attributable to overwhelming demand for COVID-19 care.</p>
