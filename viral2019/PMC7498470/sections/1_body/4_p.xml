<p id="para50">The disrupted use of viral hepatitis services in sub-Saharan Africa might have a long-term clinical effect: people newly identified as having HBsAg or anti-HCV antibody could have lost their opportunity to be linked to care, assessed for viral load, and eventually treated, and those who had been receiving antiviral therapy might have had their treatment interrupted. Moreover, in the three countries we investigated, the relative reduction in outpatient visits was substantial (&gt;70%) when comparing the period just before the COVID-19 pandemic (January, 2020) with a period during the pandemic (April, 2020). This decline was far more pronounced than was the reduction in use of routine health-care services recorded during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa (mean reduction 18·0%, 95% CI 9·5–26·5).
