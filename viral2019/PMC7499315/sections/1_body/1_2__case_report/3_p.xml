<p>A few hours after admission, the patient was noted to be febrile with temperature measured 101.3°F (38.5°C). On repeat questioning, he admitted to a mild dry cough over the last 12 hours. He denied any recent travel history or exposure to sick contacts. Medicine service was consulted, and the patient was transferred to the general medical floor. Given his symptoms, a nasopharyngeal swab was sent as part of COVID-19 surveillance, which came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The patient was put in an isolation room, and proper precautions were taken to prevent spread to healthcare workers. However, the situation was challenging due to inability to perform comforting measures like hand holding and engage in conversations from close distance. The patient was discharged on day 5 for self-quarantine at home.</p>
