<p>Coronaviruses are negatively stranded RNA viruses, with the capacity of rapid mutation and recombination. Generally, two proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms explain the bidirectional relationship between viral illness and psychiatric illness. First, the virus can be directly toxic to the brain. They are capable of replication within the nervous system; the presence of viral RNA has been previously demonstrated in the brain tissue of patients with multiple sclerosis [
