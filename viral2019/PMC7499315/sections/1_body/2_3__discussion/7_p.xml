<p>With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health care providers must recognize the relationship between mental illness and viral illness to better treat patients. Although this case cannot support causation, it does stress the bidirectional effects that physical and mental illness share.

Health care professionals and society should take note of these associations with the current pandemic and its ramifications.</p>
