<p id="Par3">A thorough understanding of the chain of infection is crucial for the prevention and control of any infectious disease, as breaking a link anywhere along the chain would stop the transmission of the infectious agent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and this theory also holds true for COVID-19. Based on this, PKUFH drafted and formulated a COVID-19 prevention and control strategy to block the chain of infection, and actively practised and explored the three links, controlling the source of infection, cutting off the transmission route, and protecting susceptible populations. This study describes the detailed methods to carry out prevention and control tasks in the ED of PKUFH (Fig.Â
