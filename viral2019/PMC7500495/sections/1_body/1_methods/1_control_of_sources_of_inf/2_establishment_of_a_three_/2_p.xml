<p id="Par6">24-h temperature monitoring stations were set up at the entrances of the ED, the entrance of the emergency hall, and the emergency triage station. Non-contact infrared temperature monitoring equipment was used at the first two stations, and electronic thermometers with higher accuracy were used at the last station. The responsibilities of the medical staff at these stations were to check patients for body temperatures and proper wearing of masks, and to educate patients on cough etiquette. Patients with fevers (forehead temperature over 37.3 °C) were provided with free surgical masks and educated to wear masks properly, and then guided by a designated person to the Fever Clinic following established routes. After ruling out the possibility of COVID-19 infection and recording the patient encounter at the Fever Clinic, patients then returned to the ED. Monitoring for abnormal body temperatures was reported daily to the administrative department for dynamic monitoring.</p>
