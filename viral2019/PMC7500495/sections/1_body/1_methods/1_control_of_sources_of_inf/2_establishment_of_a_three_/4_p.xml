<p id="Par8">Questionnaire-based survey: the epidemiological questionnaire, based on 
 <italic>New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program</italic>, was designed and updated dynamically. All patients entering the ED were requested to fill out online or paper-based questionnaires at the entrance of the emergency hall. When abnormalities were detected in the online questionnaires, SMS alerts would be sent automatically to the staff. Paper-based questionnaires were to be completed by dyslexia patients with the assistance of on-site staff. Nurses at the emergency triage station were responsible for reviewing questionnaires and providing supplemental information to attending physicians if any abnormities were noticed. After patients entered the clinic, the attending physician would again inquire history of contact and record epidemiological history in the patientâ€™s medical record routinely. Nurses at the emergency triage station would summarize abnormal situations and report to the administrative department for dynamic monitoring.
