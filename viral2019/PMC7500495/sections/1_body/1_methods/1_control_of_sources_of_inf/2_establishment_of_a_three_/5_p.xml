<p id="Par9">Itinerary verification: personal itinerary inquiry services could be obtained through the epidemic prevention and control communications big data itinerary card, launched by the Information and Communications Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This service allowed identification of where patients and their families had travelled within the country or abroad in the past 14 days, including foreign countries (regions) and domestic cities (staying over 4 h). It was used to determine whether the patient had risks of exposure to an epidemic area.</p>
