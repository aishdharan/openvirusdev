<p id="Par36">As shown in the result 3.2, the percentage of patients with critical conditions admitted to the ED during the epidemic increased significantly in comparison with the percentage in the corresponding non-epidemic period, showing that there were severe challenges in the management of the ED. First, patients underwent COVID-19 screening before being admitted to the Inpatient Departments. The processes of making appointments and pending results delayed the patient’s admission time into the hospital. Second, to avoid cross-infection, all wards in the Inpatient Departments were changed to single-patient wards, thereby beds available for patients decreased. Third, the capacity of treatment delivery to patients also decreased as a result of reduced availability of medical professionals because (1) many of them were stranded in other “lockdown” provinces and were unable to return to work, and (2) a large number of them were sent to provide medical support to the city of Wuhan. The aforementioned factors led to prolonged length of stay for high-risk patients in the ED during the epidemic, further increasing the risk of nosocomial infections and the pressure of emergency prevention and control. Therefore, timely and effective measures were of great importance to be taken in the comprehensive management of the ED to defend the "safety line" of the hospital during the epidemic.</p>
