<p id="Par40">Studies by Yu IT and others have shown that knowledge, professional skills, and attitude of hospital staff were found to be important in the prevention of HAIs in outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS in Asia and West Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To minimize infection risks of emergency medical staff, temperature monitoring staff and other personnel (such as medical guides, nursing aids, security guards, and cleaning personnel), the Joint Training Group, consisted of experts from the Prevention and Control of Healthcare-associated Infections Department and the Medical Affairs Department, conducted training and assessments. Given the characteristics of different jobs, the group used on-site demonstration teaching, online video, audio teaching, and other methods for training sessions regarding COVID-19 diagnosis and treatments, hand hygiene, use of protective equipment, medical waste disposal, throat swab specimen collection, transfer of suspected patients, and work norms. After the training, all participants were assessed and would only become qualified for deployment after successfully passing the assessments. Field practices have shown that rigorous training and assessments effectively enhance the awareness of medical staff in the ED and other related personnel in protection, and alleviate the panic of all staff to ensure a smooth and orderly work flow in the ED.
