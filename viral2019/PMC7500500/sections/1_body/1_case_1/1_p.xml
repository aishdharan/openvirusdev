<p id="Par5">A 44-year-old woman who worked in Wuhan had a history of contact with a COVID-19 patient and presented with a fever of one day and cough for one week on January 19, 2020. Her chest CT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) findings were abnormal on January 18, 2020. An RT-PCR test upon admission was positive. Laboratory examination showed a normal white blood cell count (5.01 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), normal lymphocytes (1.47 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), and decreased eosinophils (0.01 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L). She was diagnosed with COVID-19. A serial follow-up chest CT showed that the lesion was enlarged and eventually absorbed after treatment (Fig.
