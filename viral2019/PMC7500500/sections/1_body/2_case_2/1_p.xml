<p id="Par6">A 39-year-old woman who worked in Wuhan had a history of contact with a COVID-19 patient and presented with an intermittent cough and expectoration for a week on January 22, 2020. Her chest CT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) upon admission was normal. Laboratory examination showed a normal white blood cell count (5.08 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), normal eosinophils (0.03 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), and decreased lymphocytes (0.55 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L). The patient’s chest CT was abnormal and her RT-PCR test was positive after four days of hospitalization. She was diagnosed with COVID-19. A serial follow-up chest CT showed that the lesion was enlarged and partially absorbed after treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b–e).
