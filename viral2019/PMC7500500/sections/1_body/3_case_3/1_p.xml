<p id="Par7">A 38-year-old man who worked in Wuhan had a history of contact with a COVID-19 patient and presented with dizziness and fever for five days on January 30, 2020. A chest CT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) taken before admission on January 25, 2020, showed abnormalities in the middle lobe of the right lung. The patient took oral antiviral and anti-infective drugs in self-isolation at home. On January 29, a chest CT showed that the lesion was larger. Upon admission, laboratory examination showed a normal white blood cell count (3.71 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), normal lymphocytes (1.71 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), normal eosinophils (0.04 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), and decreased neutrophils (1.44 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L). The usual respiratory pathogens (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, chlamydia pneumonia, and mycoplasma pneumoniae) were excluded, and he was clinically diagnosed with suspected COVID-19. A serial follow-up chest CT showed that the lesion was enlarged and partially absorbed after treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b–d). In the end, COVID-19 was excluded due to three negative RT-PCR tests during hospitalization. Both the RT-PCR test and tests for serum antibodies were negative after discharge.
