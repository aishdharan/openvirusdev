<p id="Par10">With RT-PCR results as a reference in 1014 patients, Ai et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported that the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 97%, 25%, 68%, 65%, and 83%, respectively. Almost all patients had initial positive chest CT before or within 6Â days of the initial positive RT-PCR results. Clinical diagnostic criteria based on typical chest CT imaging features were temporarily adopted in the revised 5th edition of the Guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment, which was only applicable in Hubei Province, China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This indicates that chest CT can be very useful in screening (early detection of suspected cases) and diagnosing COVID-19 due to the rapid detection and high sensitivity for viral infections and may allow better control of viral spread.
