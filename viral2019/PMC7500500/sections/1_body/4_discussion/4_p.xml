<p id="Par11">A wide variety of chest CT findings in COVID-19 have been reported in different studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The main chest CT feature of COVID-19 pneumonia is the presence of ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation, prominent peripheral subpleural distribution, and posterior part or lower lobe predilection. The GGO may be admixed with areas of focal consolidation and associated with superimposed intralobular reticulations that result in a crazy-paving pattern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The reverse halo sign is frequently observed in patients. These characteristic features can help the epidemic area screen and preliminarily diagnose COVID-19 patients. At the same time, we also need to pay attention to the differential diagnosis. One major differential diagnosis is a pneumonia of bacterial origin. Community-acquired pneumonia is usually characterized by an airspace consolidation in one segment or lobe and the chest CT shows ground glass attenuation, centrilobular nodules, bronchial wall thickening, and mucoid impactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the absence of superinfection, COVID-19 pneumonia has no central lobular nodules or mucus impaction on chest CT. SARS, MERS, and other viral pneumonias and nonâ€‘infectious diseases should be differentiated from COVID-19 based on clinical features and imaging characteristics [
