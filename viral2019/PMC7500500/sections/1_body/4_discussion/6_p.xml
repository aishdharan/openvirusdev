<p id="Par13">The three cases above showed that chest CT could effectively screen, diagnose, and monitor COVID-19. Most studies reported that the majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were positive in both the chest CT and RT-PCR test (Case 1), and chest CT could assess the severity of lung damage, which was helpful for clinical treatment. However, there were some false negatives (Case 2) and false positives (Case 3) in chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 based on positive RT-PCR results. The reason for the false negatives in chest CT may be that the virus is located in the upper respiratory tract in the early stage and does not cause abnormal changes in the lower respiratory tract and lungs. The patients might also be in the incubation period [

The false positives in chest CT maybe due to the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 were similar to other viral pneumonia. However, some “false-positive” cases on CT may indeed be “true-positive” for the relatively low rate of positive RT-PCR results [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We suggest that RT-PCR tests should be repeated, especially for patients with a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19.
