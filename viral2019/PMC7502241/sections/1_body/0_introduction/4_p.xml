<p id="p0015">A public holiday for outbreak control—hereinafter referred to as an outbreak-control holiday—has been used as a public health policy in the past. For example, Mexico launched an outbreak-control holiday to contain the spread of H1N1 in 2009, during which schools and workplaces were closed and people were encouraged to stay at home

During such an outbreak-control holiday people do not go to work and tend to stay at home, limiting social contacts to family members and close friends. As a result, these holidays can slow down the spread of epidemics that are transmitted via social contacts

As an epidemic response strategy, an outbreak-control holiday can interrupt a wide variety of transmission routes, including direct and indirect physical contact, droplet contact, and airborne transmission. Outbreak-holidays can thus be particularly useful when a new pathogen’s precise transmission routes are not yet known
