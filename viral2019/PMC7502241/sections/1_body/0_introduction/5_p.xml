<p id="p0020">While several studies have investigated the effectiveness of travel restrictions and social distancing measures in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in China, it is still generally unclear how the trend of an epidemic changes according to different characteristics of an outbreak-control holiday

 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Taking Chinaâ€™s outbreak-control holiday as an example, this paper aims to contribute to future policy decisions by answering the following questions: What was the likely impact of the outbreak-control holiday in China on the early COVID-19 epidemic? How would this impact have varied if the following parameters of the outbreak-control holiday had been different: the duration, implementation timing, and the effectiveness of accompanying policies? Our results provide important insights for policy makers charged with designing public health interventions to control the present COVID-19 pandemic, as well as epidemics that will emerge in the future.
