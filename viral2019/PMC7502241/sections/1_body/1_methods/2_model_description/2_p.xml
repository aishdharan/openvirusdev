 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>—to simulate COVID-19 spread in China. Our model divided the population into subgroups according to the status of COVID-19 infection, including susceptible, latent infection, active infection, confirmed diagnosis, followed by treatment and recovery. In order to capture how the disease spread across provinces, we further separated the population into two regions: Hubei province, which was the center of the epidemic, and the rest of China. To capture the transmission due to travel across Hubei’s borders, our model allowed transition of the susceptible and latent infected population between Hubei and the rest of China. The infection force was proportional to the prevalence of untreated infections, including people in both latent and symptomatic infection stages. We made the following assumptions: First, we assumed that the population under treatment, although still infected, did not cause more infections because they were receiving treatment in isolated settings. Second, we did not consider reinfection among the recovered population, due to likely immunity and the relatively small size of this group. Model development and statistical analysis were performed in R(verson 3.6.3, Austria).
