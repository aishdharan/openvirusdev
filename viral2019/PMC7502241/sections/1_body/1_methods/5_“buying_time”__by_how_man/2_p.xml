<p id="p0055">We further estimated the number of days until specific levels of COVID-19 epidemic spread were reached under the different policy scenarios: ① the number of days until 10 000, 50 000, and 100 000 confirmed infections were reached; and ② the number of days until 50 000 and 100 000 cases of all infections (including confirmed/diagnosed, undiagnosed, and latent infections) were reached. We compared these numbers under the different outbreak-control holiday scenarios against the comparator scenario of “no outbreak-control holiday” to quantify the reductions in epidemic spread caused by the base case outbreak holiday and its variants.</p>
