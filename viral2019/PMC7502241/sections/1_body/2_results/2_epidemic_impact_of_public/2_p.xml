 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the epidemic impact of the outbreak-control holiday with different durations for mainland China. The vertical dashed lines indicate the starting time of the outbreak-control holiday in the base case scenario—that is, 24 January 2020. The dots represent daily cumulative confirmed infections 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The outbreak-control holiday significantly reduced infections in comparison with the “no outbreak-control holiday” scenario. The impact of the outbreak-control holiday increased with increasing duration of the holiday. The outbreak-control holiday did not immediately reduce the confirmed infections following the start of the holiday (as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(a)) because the COVID-19 incubation period is relatively long and because the holiday started during the early stage of epidemic control. The outbreak-control holiday immediately reduced all infections (as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(b)) and delayed epidemic spread in the long run. In 
 <xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Section S3 (in Appendix A)</xref>, we show the impact of the outbreak-control holiday separately for Hubei province; in 
 <xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Section S3 (in Appendix A)</xref>, we show the impact of the outbreak-control holiday for all other provinces in China.
