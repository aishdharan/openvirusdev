<p id="p0070">Compared with the “no outbreak-control holiday” scenario, the base case outbreak-control holiday delayed the time to 50 000 confirmed infections by 6.19 d and the time to 100 000 confirmed cases by 7.54 d. The delay in the time to reach 100 000 total infections was of similar magnitude (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The delay in the time to specific epidemic spread levels increased with the duration of the holiday. For example, a nationwide outbreak-control holiday with a 7-day duration would have increased the time to 100 000 confirmed infections by 4.36 d, while a nationwide outbreak-control holiday with a 21-day duration would have delayed the same number of infections by nearly 10 d.
