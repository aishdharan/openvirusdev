 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the epidemic impact of the outbreak-control holiday with different starting times. The policy impact increases with earlier starting times. This impact, however, diminishes as the epidemic progresses. If the base case outbreak-control holiday had been implemented 5 d earlier, the time to 10 000 confirmed infections would have been delayed by an additional 5.14 d. However, the earlier implementation would only have caused an additional 1.47-day delay in the time to reach 100 000 confirmed infections. If the base case outbreak-control holiday had been implemented 5 d later than in reality, the impact of the outbreak-control holiday would have been substantially weakened (
