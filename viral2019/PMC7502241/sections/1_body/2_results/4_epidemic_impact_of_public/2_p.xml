 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows the epidemic impact of the base case outbreak-control holiday in the presence of additional interventions with further effects on the transmission rate. Such interventions could substantially boost the impact of the policy. Compared with the base case outbreak-control holiday with the current calibrated reduction in the transmission rate, reducing the transmission rate by 50% or 90% results in an additional 1.69 and 6.00 d, respectively, to reach 100â€†000 confirmed infections.
