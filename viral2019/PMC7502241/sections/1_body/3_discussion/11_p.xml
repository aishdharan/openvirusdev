<p id="p0130">Our study has several limitations. First, we modeled the impact of the outbreak-control holiday policy in China, which included not only time off work but also particular measures to encourage social distancing, such information and education campaigns and the closing of public buildings, spaces, and transport systems. Replication of the impact a public holiday for outbreak control, which we estimated, will thus depend on the precise policy design, even for a very similar future epidemic. Future empirical research should identify the individual impacts of each of the key components of the outbreak-control holiday policy used in China. Second, we did not explicitly capture changing capacity for COVID-19 testing and diagnosis in our model. For the simplicity of model structure, we instead assumed an overall delay in diagnosis after the infected individuals showed symptoms, which was calibrated to the reported confirmed cases. Future modeling work should explore how the impact of outbreak-control holidays changes with growing capacity to test and diagnose COVID-19 and similar diseases as an epidemic progresses. Third, we only estimated the epidemic impact of the outbreak-control holiday, and did not quantify the impact on social and economic outcomes. Future research should identify the impact of the outbreak-control holiday on a range of outcomes and weigh them against each other in a principled way, such as through a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
