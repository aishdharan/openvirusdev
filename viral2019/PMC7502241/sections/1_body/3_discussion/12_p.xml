<p id="p0135">Taking China as an example, we show that an outbreak-control holiday can substantially dampen COVID-19 epidemic spread. Yet, if the epidemic is not fully contained during the outbreak-control holiday (i.e., there are still undetected cases in the community), cases will surge and eventually return to the trajectories observed before the holiday. Our findings thus emphasize that long-term preventive strategies are needed, which are effective even as people return to work after the holiday. The major benefit of an outbreak-control holiday thus does not lie in long-term epidemic control but in a short-term delay of epidemic spread. This delay can buy time for governments to build infrastructure for prevention and treatment and prepare processes for public health interventions. It can also buy time for scientists to generate the knowledge that can guide policy to increasingly higher levels of impact in controlling COVID-19 and similar epidemics.</p>
