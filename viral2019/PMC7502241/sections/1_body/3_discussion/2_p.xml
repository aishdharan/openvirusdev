Our model shows that the epidemic spread was substantially dampened by the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday and its subsequent extension by 3 d. The outbreak-control holiday rapidly and significantly reduced the COVID-19 transmission rate—according to our calibration results, to 55% of the pre-holiday rate in Hubei province and to 45% of the pre-holiday rate in all other provinces of China. The core strategy of the outbreak-control holiday was to substantially reduce social contacts in the population and thus prevent COVID-19 transmission from patients in pre-symptomatic phases. In contrast, without an outbreak-control strategy social contacts may actually intensify during a holiday, because people often meet during holidays and engage in social activities together, potentially exacerbating the spread of an epidemic.
