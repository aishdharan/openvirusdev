<p id="p0090">The base case scenario in our analysis was the outbreak-control holiday issued by China’s State Council during the early stage of the epidemic—a 21-day holiday for Hubei province and a 10-day holiday for all other provinces in China. In addition, we separately quantified several important components of this overall impact: the nationwide Lunar New Year holiday, which lasted 7 d; the nationwide extension of the Lunar New Year holiday by 3 days; and the additional 11-day holiday extension in Hubei province, which brought the total holiday duration in Hubei province to 21 d. The Lunar New Year holiday induced about half the impact of the overall outbreak-control holiday; the additional extension of the outbreak-control holiday in Hubei province induced about one fifth of the overall policy impact. As such, the Lunar New Year holiday, whose start incidentally coincided with the emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic, was a major driver of the overall outbreak-control holiday impact. We included the Lunar New Year holiday in the estimate of overall policy impact, because it is likely that the Chinese government would have adopted an outbreak-control holiday around a similar time as the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, if this traditional holiday had not coincided with the early phase of the epidemic. Moreover, the Chinese government already started encouraging people to stay at home and limit social contacts during the traditional holiday

Finally, future epidemic outbreaks—which outbreak-control holidays could help contain—are unlikely to coincide again with national public holidays. The overall impact of the entire holiday time, including the Lunar New Year holiday, is thus the most policy-relevant estimate.
