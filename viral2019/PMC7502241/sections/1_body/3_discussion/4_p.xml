<p id="p0095">Our second key finding is that an outbreak-control holiday is more efficient in delaying epidemic spread the earlier it is implemented and the longer it lasts. While the traditional Lunar New Year holiday coincided with the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese government acted quickly in using and extending it for outbreak control. It also extended it for a longer time in Hubei province, the original epicenter of the epidemic. Our findings here should motivate governments facing future epidemics to consider adopting extended outbreak-control holidays in the earliest stages of an emerging epidemic.</p>
