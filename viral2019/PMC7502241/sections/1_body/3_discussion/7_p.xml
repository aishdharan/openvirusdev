<p id="p0110">The goal of our study was not to replicate the entire epidemic trajectory and the control efforts during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, but rather to explore the impact of an outbreak-control holiday that primarily focused on social distancing during the early period of the epidemic and to understand how its duration and starting time would affect the pace of disease transmission in general. Governments can start outbreak-control holidays nearly immediately, because this policy does not require new infrastructures or systems: Governments merely need to announce and publicize the holiday.</p>
