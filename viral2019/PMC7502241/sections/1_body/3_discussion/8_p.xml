<p id="p0115">In contrast, other outbreak-control policies and approaches take longer to plan and implement, because they require new infrastructures or systems. We used the epidemiological data from the early stage of the epidemic (i.e., during the normal Chinese Lunar New Year holiday before 31 January) to calibrate our model of the COVID-19 transmission dynamic. This selection allows us to isolate the impact of the outbreak-control holiday from the policies and approaches that were implemented later. Such later policies and approaches included the “leave no patient unattended or untreated” strategy, which comprised of mass testing for COVID-19 and facility-based isolation and treatment of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This strategy required new infrastructure. For instance, in February 2020 the Chinese government opened new hospitals for treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, Hubei province, (the Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals) and implemented facility isolation for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in so-called Fangcang shelter hospitals

 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The combined impact of the early outbreak-control holiday and the later policies was that by March 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic was brought under control in the city of Wuhan and in the rest of China
