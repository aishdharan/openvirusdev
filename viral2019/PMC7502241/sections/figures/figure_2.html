 <caption> Epidemic impact of an outbreak-control holiday with different starting times. (a) Cumulative number of confirmed infections, (b) cumulative number of all infections (including latent and active infection). The solid line represents the base case outbreak-control holiday scenario (with 21 d in Hubei province and 10 d in all other provinces of China, both starting on 24 January, 2020), and dashed lines represent the outbreak-control holiday scenarios with starting time 5 d earlier and later, respectively. The shaded bands represent 95% uncertainty intervals of model outputs. </caption>
