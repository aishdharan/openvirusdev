<p id="Par32">As an antigen interaction and a fusion initiator, HA has a number of significant functions in the virus infection cycle. HA mediates the direct binding of the virus to specific terminal sialic acid (SA) on the cell surface and regulates the incorporation of viral genetic material through the membrane fusion process. In contrast, NA protein plays a vital role later in infection by eliminating SA from sialyloligosaccharides, which is essential for releasing newly formed virons from the viral envelope and inhibiting the self-gathering of the virus genome [
