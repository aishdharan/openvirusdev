<p id="Par35">Many studies have shown the leading role of children in influenza epidemics and pandemics (2009 A/H1N1, 2010–2011 A/H3N2, 2010–2011 A/H1N1, 2012–2013 A/H3N2 and 2013–2014 A/H1N1) with the highest relative risk ratio (RR) among all age groups [

Wardell et al. found that the risk of transmission of an infected first child to another child was 21.9%, [95% CI 14.5–30.2] higher than the corresponding risk to live with an adult, 11.4%, RR 1.9, 95 per cent CI 1.2–2.8. Compared to children [6.9%, 95% CI 4.4–10.1], adults were less likely to contribute to the spread of infection by another adult [0.6, 95% CI 0.3–0.96] [
