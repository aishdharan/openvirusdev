 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Generally, two main types of vaccines have been approved to control influenza infection, namely live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) and inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs)/trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIVs) that are US-FDA-accredited for use in children 2 years of age and pregnant women ≥ 50 years of age. LAIV is administered as a nasal spray, whereas TIV is administered intramuscularly via injection and protects against both influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains as well as influenza B viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In addition, LAIV provides more effective protection than IIV for infants and children. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP, CDC), preferably recommends LAIV for children aged 2–8 years when available immediately [
