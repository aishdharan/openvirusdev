Modern methods used to eradicate pandemic influenza infection include vaccines and antiviral agents such as adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine) and NA inhibitors (laninamivir, peramivir, oseltamivir, zanamivir).

NA inhibitors prohibit the release of virion progeny after budding from the host cell.</p>
