<p>The origin of SARS-CoV-2, its intermediary animal host, and the mechanism of its species jump to humans are not known [

 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Initially, it was believed that the COVID-19 pandemic originated at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market located in Wuhan, China, where farm animals, bats, and snakes were also sold [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; this is still believed by many people. Approximately half of the initial cases were exposed to the seafood market; however, the first two identified cases did not visit the seafood market [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Viral RNA was found in environmental samples from the wet market, such as surfaces [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the viral RNA found in the environmental samples was very closely related to viruses sampled from the earliest Wuhan patients, suggesting that the market played a role in the early spread of the virus [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The source of positive environmental samples from the market is unknown, and animal samples from the market are not available. Therefore, it has not been possible to identify an animal source at the market [
