<p>Emerging infectious diseases are becoming increasingly common [

 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The media may have reported a surge of unknown or undiagnosed cases of severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), or other related diseases prior to the official reporting of confirmed COVID-19 confirmed cases in China. Epidemic intelligence from open-source, informal data can provide early warnings of public health emergencies [
