<p>EpiWatch is an open-source epidemic observatory that was developed at the University of New South Wales as a management web application enhanced by machine learning; it has been used to collect outbreak data since 2016. The principle of EpiWatch is that cases of infectious diseases or outbreaks may be reported in the news or discussed on social media before official notification by health authorities. EpiWatch mines open-source data to detect early signals, which can be customized for common clinical infectious disease syndromes. Many countries have weak or delayed surveillance systems and poor reporting. In other countries, censorship may prevent notification of serious epidemics. Open-source data can be used to help identify epidemic signals in such circumstances.</p>
