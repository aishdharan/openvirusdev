<p>The system includes three major features. First, reports are gathered from international organizations and news outlets by an intelligent and modular system. An administrator can easily add new sources without requiring further development of the application. The data collected include news reports and social media posts as well as grey literature, such as government reports. If the format in which data is delivered changes for a given source, an administrator can promptly modify the system to adapt to this change. This includes adding or changing the languages used for searching. The system is set up to support a variety of intelligent data gathering elements, such as natural language processing algorithms, regular expression matching, and supervised machine learning algorithms, to process reports and attempt to identify important data points such as outcomes, locations, and diseases mentioned within the gathered data.</p>
