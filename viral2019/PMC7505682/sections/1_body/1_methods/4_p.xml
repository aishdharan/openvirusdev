<p>Finally, the EpiWatch management web application consists of two software programs. One is a web application that is built on the Vue framework, and the other is a server-side application built on the NodeJS framework. Both applications are written in JavaScript. The third software program is the data-gathering program, which is also a NodeJS application written in JavaScript. This program is scheduled to run on a regular basis to re-scan sources at intervals chosen by the system administrator. Searches can be tailored for specific languages or regions as well as for specific infectious disease syndromes. The data are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Most of the data is textual in nature and is easily compressed; therefore, the storage requirements are currently very modest (&lt;100 MB). The EpiWatch observatory is managed and funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centre of Research Excellence, Integrated Systems for Epidemic Response (ISER) and is managed by staff at the Biosecurity Program, The Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales Sydney.</p>
