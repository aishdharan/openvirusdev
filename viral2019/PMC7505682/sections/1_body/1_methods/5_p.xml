<p>To capture early reports of SARI or pneumonia-related illnesses in China, searches were performed in the Chinese language using keywords reflecting severe acute respiratory syndrome or pneumonia as well as Wuhan and China as geolocations. We performed searches from October 1, 2019, to February 14, 2020. Any relevant news reports with the keywords 
 <italic>pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>SARI</italic> and related terms, and 
 <italic>coronavirus</italic> were extracted. The information before December 31, 2019 (the date on which the WHO was notified of the COVID-19 outbreak) was reviewed for potential early signals of COVID-19. Google and the Chinese search engine Baidu were used [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Reports in Chinese were retrieved and reviewed by EK, XC, and MZ and translated to English.
