<p>Between October 2019 and February 2020, a total of 218 reports were found and included in the study. There were no duplicates. We identified two potentially relevant news reports prior to December 31, 2019. 
 <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the number of pneumonia and/or SARI reports from October 1, 2019, to February 14, 2020. It shows an increase in reports after the official notification to the WHO on December 31, 2019. A report appeared on December 26, 2019, with the heading “One sample is suspected as novel coronavirus”; this report appears to have been retracted, as the link to the news item has become invalid [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We found 11 reports of cases of pneumonia between October 1 and December 31, 2019, including a case identified retrospectively in March 2020, which is believed to be an index case. The number of reports in the same period one year prior was determined for comparison; there were 12 reports in 2018. Of the 11 reports in 2019, 3 (27%) were cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and 7 (64%) had known causes; 2 reports (18%) were related to pulmonary nodules, 3 (27%) were caused by lung cancer, cerebral infarction, or asthma, and 2 cases (18%) were caused by bacterial infection. The information of interest was the single report of unknown serious pneumonia in November 2019 in Hubei, the province in China where the COVID-19 pandemic arose.
