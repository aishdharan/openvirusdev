<p>The origin of the COVID-19 epidemic is unknown. Only half the initial patients were exposed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the first two cases in Wuhan did not visit the market. No pneumonia or SARI signals in Wuhan were identified prior to December 31, which supports the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19. However, open-source intelligence identified a case of severe pneumonia in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, 325 km from Wuhan, who was transferred to Wuhan for treatment on November 21, 2019. This case may be part of an early outbreak cluster. In early March, it was reported that the first case of COVID-19, a different case identified retrospectively, may have been observed on November 17 [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Approximately one COVID-19 incubation period (2 weeks) [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] after November 17 to November 21, the first formally reported cases in Wuhan became symptomatic (around December 1-8). If no definitive diagnosis was made, further diagnostic investigation of the case from Xiangyang and epidemiological investigation is warranted to determine if this case did have COVID-19. There may be a connection between the Xiangyang patient and an unidentified early cluster of COVID-19.
