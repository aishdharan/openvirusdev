<p>From December 31, 2019, through January 3, 2020, a total of 44 case patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were detected by syndromic surveillance by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was initially suspected to be the origin of the virus, and the market was closed on January 1, 2020. At least 35 environmental samples from the seafood section of the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan tested positive for the virus [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the first two cases did not report visiting the seafood market, and there is no epidemiological link between the first patient and later cases [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This, together with the identification of at least two severe pneumonia cases in November (the one identified in this study and the case on November 17, 2019), suggests that the epidemic originated earlier than December 2019.
