<p>Epidemic diseases grow exponentially and rapidly [
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], as seen in China, Europe, and the United States [
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Early detection and epidemic control can reduce epidemic growth and prevent further spread. Open-source intelligence is a potential tool to aid early detection, especially where formal surveillance data are lacking. Although these data are not validated, once a signal is detected, it can and should be formally investigated, tested, and validated. The use of open-source epidemic intelligence can supplement conventional surveillance to provide early detection of serious emerging epidemics, especially where official disease surveillance reporting is lacking.
