<p>The “death rate” is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from COVID-19 by the number of all who were infected with the virus. For the COVID-19 infection, the death rate cannot be as high as 3.4%, which was an estimate quoted by the Director of the World Health Organisation in the early days of the epidemic [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In that estimate, the denominator was based only on persons who had reasons to be tested and were then confirmed positive for coronavirus. In doing so, the denominator did not include all those infected who were not tested. We could not say how many of them existed in any population.
