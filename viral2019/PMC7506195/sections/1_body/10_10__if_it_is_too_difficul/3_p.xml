<p>We knew then about the Hubei province that more than 2000 died and that the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed infected was 3.8%, and in the City of Wuhan, it was as high as 5.8% [

Specifically, infected physicians at Wuhanâ€™s hospitals had a significantly milder clinical picture when compared to their patients with severe COVID-19. This was a sign that patients in hospitals represented only the extreme end of the clinical presentation, ie, the most severe part of the much broader range of symptoms among the wider population. How many more were actually infected on the streets of Wuhan and had milder symptoms? No one knew.
