<p>Wuhan is a huge city with 11 million inhabitants. There could have been as many as 100 000 infected at the time, as the first figures used to compute the “death rate” suggested. But there could have been as many as a million. If this was the case, then the first estimates of “death rates” of 3–6% should have been divided by ten. But because of the size of Wuhan, the number of infected could have theoretically been as high as 10 million. If that was the case, then the first estimates of “death rates” should have been divided by one hundred.</p>
