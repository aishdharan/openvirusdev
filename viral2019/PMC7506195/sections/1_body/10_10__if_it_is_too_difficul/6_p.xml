<p>On the 1
 <sup>st</sup> of March, 2020, I made a public prediction of an estimate of “death rate” that was between 0.5–1.0%. In doing so, I said that even a “death rate” of 0.5% was actually a “conservative” estimate since those infected in Wuhan could in principle be between ten and a hundred times higher, due to Wuhan’s sheer size. But, if it is indeed less than 0.5%, it’s already in the rough area of the rate of death from more severe flu.
