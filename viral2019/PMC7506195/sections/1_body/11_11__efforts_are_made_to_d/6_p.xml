<p>In their early addresses at the end of February 2020, many epidemiologists suspected that the victims would be predominantly elderly people. For most COVID-19 victims, their lives would be shortened by several years, which would be spent at an older age and undergoing treatment for pre-existing illnesses. There is also another important detail that epidemiologists also emphasized in their first addresses, but due to the then lower level of understanding of pandemics, only a few people noticed or understood that point. In the beginning, journalists and the general public were primarily concerned with the question of the “death rate”, and whether the virus could mutate to increase it and kill more people among those infected. At first glance, that does seem to be the most important question. But many epidemiologists kept saying that the virus could also mutate in another way, to start spreading more rapidly. I personally stated this publicly as early as on the 27th of February, saying that I was actually more worried about that possibility.</p>
