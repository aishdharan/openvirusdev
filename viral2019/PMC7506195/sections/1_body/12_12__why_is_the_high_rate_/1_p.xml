<p>The problem of the rapid spread of the virus, measured through R0 parameter, seemed far less important to the public at the time than the “death rate”. But it presents a greater challenge to epidemiologists when they are planning measures to contain the epidemic than the “death rate” itself does. From an epidemiologist’s perspective, even a very high “death rate” at which we can still monitor and isolate all infected persons and their contacts is easier to deal with than a low “death rate” with a very rapid spread. The best example is this new coronavirus, which has caused us significantly greater problems with its death rate of around 1% compared to SARS, MERS and Ebola, whose death rates were 10%, 35%, and about 50%.</p>
