<p>When the virus arrived in Europe, my concern over the speed of its spread has, unfortunately, came to fruition. The virus’ “spread rate” seemed to be underestimated initially. Its rapid spread made the novel coronavirus significantly more dangerous than its “death rate” did. Initial estimates of the R0 coefficient were around 2.2, but in my own calculations the behavior of the virus in Europe was more consistent with the values within the range of 2.5-4.0, if not more [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This meant that each infected individual could infect another three to four healthy individuals. There has even been a pre-publication recently claiming that it was 5.7 [
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is possible, however, that this estimate is somewhat too high, but values higher than 3.0 would imply a very rapid spread and should not be underestimated.
