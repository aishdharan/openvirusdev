<p>Unlike other diseases that health care systems regularly face, COVID-19 also has a “fourth dimension” − time. It uses this additional dimension to cause problems that we are simply not used to. In medicine, doctors see too many cases of a certain illness at the same time when, eg, the trauma clinic needs to deal with injured people from a large train or bus crash and they do not have sufficient capacity to help everyone. Another example is wartime surgery, where several military surgeons would need to deal with the sudden emergence of a large number of wounded soldiers following an unforeseen battlefield tragedy. But beyond those rare examples, having too many patients with the same life-threatening condition at the same time is not something that medical professionals often need to worry about.</p>
