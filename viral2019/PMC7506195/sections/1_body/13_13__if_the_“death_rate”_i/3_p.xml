<p>So, let’s suppose for a moment that this relatively small “death rate” of somewhere between 0.5% and 1% for most western populations is really the only danger associated with it. Then, the new coronavirus could be compared to a monster slowly approaching us from afar. We can see increasingly clearly that the monster is physically small, it reaches only up to our waist. So, we begin to relax. We assume that we should be able to knock something that small to the floor and master it. But, we are only looking at it from the front as it approaches. We cannot check what it has behind its back. There, in a dimension we cannot see, this short monster is hiding three metal bars. When the monster finally stands right before us, if we let him out of our sight for one moment, he will be able to hit us over the head with one of these metal bars at an unbelievable speed.</p>
