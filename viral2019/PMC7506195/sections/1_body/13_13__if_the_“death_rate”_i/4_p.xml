<p>The first problem that the new coronavirus causes us from that fourth dimension, beyond the death rate itself, is its rapid spread. If we allow it to spread freely among the population, it will infect hundreds of thousands from just one infected person in only a matter of a month or two. Even with a small “death rate”, it will soon lead to thousands of severely ill patients who would require intensive care. All those who do not receive care would then die of suffocation. They would die alone in hospitals because their families would not be allowed to the infected wards. The burial conditions of all the deceased would also be limited and quite different from the usual customs. This is not a fate that anyone would wish on an older member of their family, so it should be avoided.</p>
