<p>Another big problem is that the new coronavirus has two faces. When it spreads in the community it is relatively harmless, causing mild to moderate symptoms in most people. But, when it enters into a vulnerable population, such as hospital wards, rehabilitation centers, or retirement homes, it spreads at a tremendous rate, because everyone is particularly receptive. The main problem, though, is that the coronavirus “death rate” then increases by at least ten or twenty times. Among such subgroups, it can kill up to every fifth or tenth infected person, depending on how old and sick they already are. In many European Union countries, a considerable proportion of the total number of deaths was caused by severe outbreaks occurring in retirement homes.</p>
