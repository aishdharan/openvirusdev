<p>The third metal bar this little monster has in its arsenal is the indirect effect of the virus on the health system, which causes mortality from all other diseases to increase. Specifically, if the virus was simply allowed to spread freely, hospitals would temporarily be crowded with infected patients, doctors, nurses, as well as people who come for check-ups or visits. Many health care professionals would end up either on sick leave due to COVID-19 or in self-isolation so as not to spread the infection to patients in serious conditions. Many patients would then be moved out of hospitals for home care. A disruption of the health system would cause those with other health conditions to die more frequently.</p>
