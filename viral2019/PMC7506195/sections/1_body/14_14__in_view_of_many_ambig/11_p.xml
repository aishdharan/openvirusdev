<p>Similar to the question of singing on balconies or going out for a walk, the risk of getting infected through touching packages in supermarkets is probably very small, but until it is better explored, it cannot be completely ruled out. However, those who become infected in this way are likely to have a significantly lower initial entry dose of the virus than via inhaled air. Therefore, the course of the disease may be milder, although science has yet to confirm that hypothesis. But it would be no surprise to epidemiologists if this was proven, although it should always be reiterated that surprises are always possible with new viruses.</p>
