<p>We are being confronted with a virus that has shown that it spreads rapidly and very successfully among humans, and it was not yet clear how. Such viruses are usually transmitted by droplets of exhaled air, but also by fingers after someone who is infected touches their eyes or their mouth and nose. We can expect the presence of the virus in tears, mucus from the nose, and in saliva. Another person may inhale it, but also touch the location or object that an infected person has previously touched.</p>
