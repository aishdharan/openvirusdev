<p>A great deal of scientific research on COVID-19 is currently being conducted in a way that would be quite unacceptable to rigorous science under usual circumstances. All work seems to be done at speed, using very small samples that are often not sufficiently representative for the general population. This highlights only some of the imperfections of COVID-19-related research. Many details that must normally be carefully considered in study design are being neglected in the interest of speed. This led to a parallel epidemic of superficial research, seeking to answer the open questions as soon as possible. Unfortunately, a quick-but-wrong answer can do more harm than the one that is obtained more slowly, but which ends up being correct. But decision-making needs are time-sensitive, which should also be appreciated. This is why decisions in this crisis would often be made using suboptimal information.</p>
