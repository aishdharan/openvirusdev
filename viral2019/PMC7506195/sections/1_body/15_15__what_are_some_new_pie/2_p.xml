<p>An additional issue is that just about every piece of published research received immediate and massive media attention globally. This drove researchers to publish so-called “pre-prints”. Those are scientific papers that anyone could write and publish on a platform for pre-publications, without them being subjected to a serious scientific and professional scrutiny through peer-review. Scientists are trained to understand whether those pre-prints are serious research or have major shortcomings. However, journalists and the general public will have a much harder time assessing that. Therefore, we entered a cycle of daily media reports on various “scientific discoveries” which either proved false or unfounded in about a week or two. It’s a shame that so much time and media space was devoted to unfounded reports and results. It was one of the basic features of the “infodemia” that has now taken hold.</p>
