<p>One research question worth exploring is whether the virus can return and infect again those who have already had COVID-19 and were negative on their coronavirus tests [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This is now being investigated in more detail. It is possible that sporadic reports of such reinfections can be explained by the tests not being reliable enough, or that it may take much longer for the virus to completely disappear from the body than was initially thought. However, if it turns out that those who have already had the disease can become infected again very soon after getting over COVID-19, that would be very unfavorable. It would mean that the acquired immunity is not permanent and that the vaccine may not be able to help as much as we had hoped. But, it is still too early for such conclusions.
