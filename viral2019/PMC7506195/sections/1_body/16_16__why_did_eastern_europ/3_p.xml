<p>However, the most important individual factor that determined the epidemiological situation in western and eastern Europe during the first wave of the pandemic was the pattern of population mobility. Western European countries that had lots of air travel with China and also heavy traffic in all forms between themselves in February and early March had a lot of infected cases imported. At this time of the year, countries of eastern Europe had considerably less traffic through their borders. Wherever there was more international traffic, there was more virus imported, and vice versa. Then, the key factor of the eventual success was the response. If the “first line of response” worked well through February and early March and then the lockdown was introduced timely, the results in containing the epidemic were excellent [

If “testing, tracing and isolating” were not implemented stringently and the lockdown measures were introduced late, the result was much worse − there were many cases and deaths. So, the differences between western and eastern Europe can be explained through patterns of population mobility − more international travel and late lockdowns led to tragedies, while less international travel and early lockdowns led to good results [
