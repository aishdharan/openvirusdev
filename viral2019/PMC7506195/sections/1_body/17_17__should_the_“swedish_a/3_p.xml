<p>In addition, the proportion of the population that needs to be infected to achieve “herd immunity” depends on the R0 parameter of the new coronavirus, which was not known with sufficient certainty at the time. When R0 is about 2–3, then it is enough to infect about 60% of people. But if R0 is about 5–6, and it could be, then up to 80% or more of people. Therefore, planning for “herd immunity” without a more clearly defined R0 value was actually infecting the population rather blindly − the target proportion was unknown, and so was the number of potential victims.</p>
