<p>As of the 29th of March, the Swedish government has banned public gatherings of more than 50 people. Clear recommendations have also been introduced for people over the age of 70 not to leave their homes if they can avoid it. All who can are invited to work from home, avoiding all trips that are not necessary, and tend to be outside the house only when they are not crowded. Sanctions were indicated for non-compliance with these measures [

 <sup>st</sup> of April population was banned from visiting retirement homes, after it became clear that the virus had already penetrated half of those homes in Stockholm [

Much of the population has since lived in a way that has made it very difficult for the virus to spread. Accordingly, a slowdown in the number of newly infected was observed, which is somewhat slower than in other countries, but still present.
