<p>As a result of this controversy in the media, many citizens − especially the elderly − withdrew to their homes and further strengthened the quarantine nature of the “Swedish model”. It should be understood that, after all these events, nothing so different is happening in Sweden from other countries, so we should expect similar outcomes. However, the media of many countries, as well as individuals on social networks, continued to write about the “Swedish model” myth for various reasons and motives. Some saw a good alternative story in this − “alone against all”, or “no social distancing measures are needed”. Others had simply felt anti-lockdown for various reasons, so they promoted the myth of “no measures in Sweden” to undermine the work by epidemiologists in their own countries. But this is just another in an endless series of insufficiently accurate information that this crisis abounds in. Fortunately, reasonable solutions eventually prevailed everywhere, even in Sweden itself.</p>
