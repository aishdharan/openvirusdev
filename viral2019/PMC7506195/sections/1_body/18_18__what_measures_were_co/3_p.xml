<p>If the virus turned out to be considerably more dangerous than we thought, or if it spread much faster, then we would need further approaches to ensure population safety. If we ever become confronted with a virus that kills many more among those infected, innovative defenses could then even consider “dividing” the population into several separate subgroups to “dilute” the people who are available to the virus. This would turn any nation that chooses this approach into a so-called “metapopulation”. Subgroups would be able to leave homes and work on different days.</p>
