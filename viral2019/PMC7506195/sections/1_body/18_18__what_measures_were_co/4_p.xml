<p>This approach is similar to a ship or submarine that is internally divided into bulkheads, so they can protect it from sinking if the hull breaks somewhere. That way, if a considerably more dangerous virus triggered an epidemic within one of these subpopulations, it would not spread to the others. A two-day working week during alternate days for every subpopulation may prevent the virus from spreading day-by-day and growing exponentially. Clearly, this is a measure for the worst-case scenarios and more dangerous viruses. “Metapopulation approach” would still allow nine working days a month, with additional work from home where possible.</p>
