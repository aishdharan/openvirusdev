<p>Several exit strategies were being considered in most countries during the lockdown. The first one was “complete virus elimination”. This is clearly not eradication, because eradication depends on all countries eliminating the virus. This no longer seems possible until we get a vaccine, but elimination within the country’s borders is a desirable solution if realistic. It requires early quarantine, prolonged high level of discipline of the population, a strong economy that can withstand the quarantine and geographical location that facilitates future surveillance on virus entry and its control using only the “first line of defense”. This kind of approach could lead to ”corona-free zones” all over the world that could exchange people and goods without any concern over the SARS-CoV-2 spreading. Iceland, New Zealand, and Cuba are ideally placed to consider this strategy.</p>
