<p>As a result, the World Health Organisation delayed the declaration of a pandemic until the 11

By this time, no-one had the opportunity to monitor and study its free spread, nor to determine the speed of the spread. This is because the virus was suppressed by a strict quarantine in Wuhan soon after its presence was realized and confirmed. Everywhere else, it was controlled through the first lines of defense.
