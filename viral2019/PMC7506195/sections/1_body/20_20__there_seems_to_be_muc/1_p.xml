<p>At the end of the first phase, in which the virus spread initially, and the second phase during which it was slowed down through lockdowns, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will likely split the countries into two very broad groups. The first group will comprise countries that prepared very well and reacted early to the epidemic. They focused on managing the epidemic and “crushed the epidemic curve”. This will likely also reduce the impact on their economies. The second group of countries was those that considered alternative options and/or reacted too late, or that simply neglected the problem. Those countries will have high numbers of infected, many deaths, and prolonged lockdown. The impact on their economies is still likely to be substantial. So, the first likely lesson will be that it is better to confront any emerging public health problem, learn about it, and deal with it, rather than neglect it.</p>
