<p>Coronavirus will cause losses for humanity in 2020 on the one hand, but it will reduce losses on the other. For example, it will reduce the number of traffic accidents, the number of victims of violence, and deaths from polluted air. In addition, until recently there were political fights around every percent reduction in fossil fuel use. Now, all of a sudden, this reduction came in an enforced and massive move. In a rather improbable way, this pandemic at least helps combat humanityâ€™s climate change problem.</p>
