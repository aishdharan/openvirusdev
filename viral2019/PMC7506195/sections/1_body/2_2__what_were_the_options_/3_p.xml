It was going to be increasingly difficult to expect that people would adhere to the level of strict social distancing required to keep the epidemic under control.

Then, if many people started ignoring anti-epidemic measures and went back to their pre-COVID-19 lifestyles, many would get infected soon thereafter. Countries would then need to start a new cycle of isolation because their health systems would be unable to handle large numbers of infected people with a severe form of the disease.</p>
