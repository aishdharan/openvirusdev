<p>This was quite clear to the leaders of the western countries, which is why some were keen to seek their own, third approach. But the approach that would be even worse than these two extreme scenarios was to initially confront the epidemic with one strategy and then change it after a few weeks and move on to the alternative approach. Consistent adherence to the first solution would at least save the maximum number of human lives, albeit only temporarily, but it would significantly harm the economy. Conversely, consistent adherence to the alternative solution would preserve the economy and lifestyle, at least in theory, but with significant loss of life that was extremely difficult to estimate at the time. But, if the leaders picked one initially, and after a few weeks they had to change their minds and choose the other, then both the economy would suffer and the casualties would be quite large. So, governments were facing two seemingly very bad solutions, and the alternation between them would be even worse.</p>
