<p>To make the choice even harder than it had seemed already, it had to be made under major uncertainties over nearly all key parameters. The leaders could not be entirely sure what was the case-fatality rate (CFR) of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 âˆ’ or its infection-fatality rate (IFR), if there were many asymptomatic cases of infection, which still needed to be established. They did not know the spread rate, either, ie, the R0 parameter. They did know that the growth of cases would be exponential. There was also a major uncertainty over the extent of risk by age and sex. This was mainly because the data from China lumped many age groups together and it was uncertain at the time if COVID-19 may be dangerous for younger people, too [
