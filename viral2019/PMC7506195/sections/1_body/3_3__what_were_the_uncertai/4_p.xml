<p>In addition to uncertainties over the “death rate” of the virus, the other uncertainty that worried many epidemiologists was that it “spread rate” remained unknown. If very high, it could make the indirect effects of the new virus worse than the direct ones. It could generate many severe cases that could not be helped due to a health system overload. The consequent overload of the health system would indirectly lead to further casualties due to the inadequate treatment of all other diseases. For this reason, it was extremely difficult to estimate the effects of the free spread of the virus and the number of likely casualties. At the same time, the negative effects of quarantines on human mental health and well-being were also expected. The consequences of economic hardship for many people over the years to come were also very difficult to assess.</p>
