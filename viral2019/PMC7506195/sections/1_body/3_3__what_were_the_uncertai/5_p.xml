<p>The strategy of allowing the free spread of the virus was also very dangerous because it was impossible to predict the ways in which the virus could mutate after infecting so many human carriers. Some new strains could, in principle, become more severe than the current one. A further danger of this strategy was that even low levels of risk for young people would translate into very large numbers if millions were infected. Relatively young victims would surely become a central focus of reporting on the epidemic and undermine any support that this strategy may have enjoyed beforehand.</p>
