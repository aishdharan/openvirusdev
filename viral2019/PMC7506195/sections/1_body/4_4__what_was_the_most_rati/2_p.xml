 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It became popular as “The Hammer and the Dance.” The governments of many countries resorted to some variant of this strategy. It was reasonable as it protected people’s lives and the health system, but it also tried to protect the economy as much as possible. The ‘’hammer” was an intensive lockdown, as brief as possible, that would reverse the flow of the epidemic and reduce the number of infected. The ‘’dance” would then be the next phase − our coexistence with the virus − where we would not allow it to spread quickly to a large number of people.
