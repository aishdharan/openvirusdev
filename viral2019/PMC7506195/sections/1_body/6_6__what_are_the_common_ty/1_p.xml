<p>We have seen four different types of strategies. I will rank them from the least to the most interventionist. The first type of response was to allow the virus to spread among the population. The idea was to partly expose the population to the virus. If we could “immunize” ourselves while preserving reasonably normal life, there was a hope that economic activities would not be too disrupted. Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, and, to a certain extent, Germany, led the way in this regard.</p>
