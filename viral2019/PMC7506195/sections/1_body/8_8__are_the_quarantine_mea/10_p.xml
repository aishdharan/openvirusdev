<p>To summarise, the COVID-19 pandemic may, in some unforeseen way, be resolved faster than it appears possible at this point. After that, economies may recover very quickly, or they may not. We are yet to observe this in the coming months. But for many decades, the development of the economy has always meant better human health. It also worked the other way around, meaning that the better health of the people also contributed to economic productivity. However, in this unusual and entirely new situation, the concern for public health threatens the functioning of the economy.</p>
