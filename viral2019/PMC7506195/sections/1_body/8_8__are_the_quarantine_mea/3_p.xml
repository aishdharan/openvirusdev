<p>In some countries, a specific problem arose: the results of their health care system’s fight to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were so good, that an increasing number of people no longer saw the measures as justified. Some start criticizing the measures openly. They did not understand that they only encountered few victims during the lockdown precisely because the measures were timely and rigorous. In that sense, some countries are slowly becoming “victims” of their own good results.</p>
