<p>The premise for such thinking is that in this first epidemic wave, the level of the population exposure sufficient for “collective immunity” against coronavirus and stopping its further spread will be reached. This level, however, depends on the “spread rate” of the virus, ie, its infectivity. Unfortunately, the level of infectiousness of the new coronavirus appears to be somewhat higher than the initial estimates from Wuhan initially suggested. This then requires a higher proportion of the population to get over the infection to reach collective immunity and stop the epidemic.</p>
