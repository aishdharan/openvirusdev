<p>Furthermore, in the context of population exposure strategies to preserve the economy, one should also have faith that this immunity will be long-lasting. There has not yet been enough time for this to be explored scientifically, let alone clearly confirmed. Finally, it is hoped that the genome of this virus will remain relatively stable. If it mutates from year to year, much like the flu virus does, the immunity acquired the previous year will no longer protect someone the following year. If we do not receive the vaccine or effective medicines by then, we will have to face a large number of new coronavirus victims once again. This would make all the casualties of the first wave of the epidemic that died so that the rest of the population develops “herd immunity” rather futile, as they could have been prevented with the introduction of lockdowns.</p>
