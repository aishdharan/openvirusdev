<p>If we underestimate this virus after we leave quarantine, coronavirus’ free spread among the population will likely occur again. If people start dying of COVID-19 again in large numbers, it is likely that many people would retreat inside their homes as they did initially. Then, it would be difficult to “save the economy”. If it were so easy to get out of this situation, countries across the world would not be resorting to these strict anti-epidemic lockdown measures. In the vast majority of them, national economies are highly dependent on small and medium-sized companies and as such, they are all in a similar situation. Therefore, countries should work as actively as possible to plan their exit from quarantine, but also to do this with a good deal of caution.</p>
