<p>What does this mean for countries that locked down early and successfully? Suppose they all manage to reduce the number of people infected within their borders to just a hundred by their quarantines. Those hundred infected people would not be apparent to anyone when the lockdown is lifted. They would need to be discovered through testing. This would be done based on the symptoms that they would all develop. Unfortunately, if all the precautions are abolished, those one hundred infected may lead to a thousand infected in just one week, and then ten thousand in the next week. This could lead to a new lockdown. This virus is spreading so quickly and so easily, with such a high rate of spread, that it presents us with very difficult decisions to make.</p>
