<p id="p0006">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease that was identified toward the end of the year 2019 in China, and which became a pandemic in the first quarter of the year 2020 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. After its identification in 2019, COVID-19 has been a source of active research from various scientific points of view, mainly due to the mortality rate derived from this disease and the inherent health complications. Indeed, to this day, the COVID-19 dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University reports a total of 5,439,559 cases in 188 countries around the World, along with 2,185,696 recovered individuals and 345,589 deaths worldwide 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. On the other hand, the usual symptoms of this disease include fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, but it may develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, septic shock and blood clots, among other conditions 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In some cases, these symptoms evolve rapidly resulting ultimately in a painful death. Needless to mention that there are other severe consequences on the propagation of this disease worldwide, including economic and financial outcomes which are difficult to assess at this stage of the pandemic. Some reports already have started to investigate these potential consequences at various geographic levels 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, though the full extent of the implications of the global spread of COVID-19 are still under scientific scrutiny.
