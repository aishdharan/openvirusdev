<p id="p0009">In this manuscript, we will consider a SEIQR model for the propagation of COVID-19. The system will consist of a nonlinear set of coupled ordinary differential equations in which various real parameters are included. The use of such model is based on the current understanding of the mechanisms of propagation of COVID-19. In particular, the consideration of the subpopulations of susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined and recover individuals is strongly supported by both the effects of COVID-19 in human health and the measures adopted by the governments of all countries affected 
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Various assumptions will be imposed on the problem considered in this work, and we will obtain a system of ordinary differential equations from those hypotheses. We will provide a stability analysis of the equilibrium points of the system in the presence and absence of COVID-19. The nature of the local stability of those equilibria will be thoroughly investigated with respect to the basic reproduction number. As a means to verify our theoretical results, we will propose a two-level finite difference discretization of the SEIQR model. Our approach will hinge on a non-local discretization of the continuous problem, and we will show that the discrete model has various numerical and structural properties which make it a desirable tool in the simulation of the SEIQR system. For instance, we will prove the linear stability of the scheme, along with its capability to preserve the positivity of solutions. This feature is of the utmost importance in view that the variables under investigation are population sizes
