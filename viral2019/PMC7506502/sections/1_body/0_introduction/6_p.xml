<p id="p0010">The present work is organized as follows. In 
 <xref rid="sec0003" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>, we will introduce the mathematical model under investigation. As we pointed out before, the system will be a general nonlinear SEIQR model with constant spatial diffusion. The assumptions on the derivation of the model will be provided therein, and the model will include various physically relevant constants to make it as realistic as possible. In that section, we will obtain the equilibrium points both in the presence and the absence of COVID-19. We will obtain the reproduction number in that stage, and various results on the local stability of the equilibria will be rigorously established. The numerical model employed to solve the SEIQR model is presented in 
 <xref rid="sec0003" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>. The scheme is a nonstandard model in the sense of R. E. Mickens 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We will show therein that the scheme is a stable technique which is able to preserve the positivity of the solutions. In other words, our computational methodology is a structure-preserving technique or, equivalently, a dynamically consistent technique. As the end of that section. we provide some simulations that illustrate the main analytical features of the numerical methodology, and we close this manuscript with a section of concluding remarks.
