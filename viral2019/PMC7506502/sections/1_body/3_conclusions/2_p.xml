<p id="p0052">In this work, we considered a generic SEIQR system to model the propagation of COVID-19. The model employed here consisted of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations of first order. Various constant parameters were used to describe the system and nonnegative initial conditions were employed. The method considered the presence of susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined and recovered populations in light of the known dynamics of COVID-19. The mathematical model was obtained from epidemiological assumptions, and equilibrium points were obtained considering the presence and the absence of the epidemic. The reproductive number was obtained, and the stability of the equilibria was established in terms of the values of the reproductive number. Both local and global stability were analyzed. Also, a finite-difference method was proposed to investigate computationally the dynamics of COVID-19. The method is nonlocal, and we proved the positivity of the scheme, along with the discrete stability of the equilibrium points. In addition, the numerical properties of consistency, stability and convergence were rigorously established. Some numerical simulations proved the validity of the theorems on the stability of the equilibrium points. In this way, the present work contributes to the design of SEIQR models to describe the dynamics of infectious diseases like COVID-19
