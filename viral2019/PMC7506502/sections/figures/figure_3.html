 <caption> Solution of the system (2.1) versus time using the method (3.2), considering (a) a system free of COVID-19 and (b) a system with the presence of COVID-19. We employed the parameters of Table 1, and the initial conditions are S 0 = 0.5 , E 0 = 0.2 , I 0 = 0.1 , Q 0 = 0.1 , R 0 = 0.1 and τ = 0.01 . (c) Dynamics of the model (2.1) when it transits from COVID-19 present to COVID-19 absent with q 1 = 0.014 . (d) Dynamics of the infected individuals depending on the parameter q 1. </caption>
