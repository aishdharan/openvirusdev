<p id="Par27">Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from the end of February to the end of May 2020 at the Brescia Civic Hospital, (Brescia, Lombardy, Italy), using FLOQSwabs in the universal transport medium (UTM) (COPAN, Brescia, Italy). Viral RNA was extracted from 300 µl of UTM with Nimbus automatic system (Arrow Diagnostics, Genoa, Italy), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification was performed on BioRad CFX PCR machine (Bio-Rad Laboratories S.r.l., Milan, Italy) using the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene Inc. Seoul, Korea) reagents which detects conserved regions in ORF1ab, E and N genes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
