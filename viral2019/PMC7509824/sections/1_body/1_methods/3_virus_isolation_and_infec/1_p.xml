<p id="Par29">PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs were diluted 1:2 with DMEM supplied with 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 1% amphotericin B (Merck) before adding to Vero E6 cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the inoculum was removed, washed with warm phosphate saline buffer (PBS, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) twice, and replaced with fresh culture medium containing antimicrobials and 2% FBS. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and observed daily by light microscopy for cytopathic effects (CPE). Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. Cell infection was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Cell subculturing was performed by seeding rescued cells (1:2) in fresh medium. All procedures were carried-out in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory.</p>
