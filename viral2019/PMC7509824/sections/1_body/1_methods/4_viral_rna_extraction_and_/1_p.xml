<p id="Par30">RNA was extracted from clarified cell culture supernatants (16,000 g x 10 min) using QIAamp Viral RNA
 <sup>®</sup> Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted in 30 μl of RNase-free water and stored at –80 °C until use. The qRT-PCR was carried-out following previously described procedures with minor modifications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Briefly, reverse transcription and amplification of the S gene were performed using the one-step QuantiFast Sybr Green RT-PCR mix (Qiagen) as follows: 50 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 5 min; 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s (40 cycles) (primers: RBD-qF1: 5′-CAATGGTTTAACAGGCACAGG-3′ and RBD-qR1: 5′-CTCAAGTGTCTGTGGATCACG-3). Standard curve was obtained by cloning the receptor binding domain of S gene (primers: RBD-F: 5′-GCTGGATCCCCTAATATTACAAACTTGTGCC-3′; RBD-R: 5′-TGCCTCGAGCTCAAGTGTCTGTGGATCAC-3′) into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A standard curve was generated by determination of copy numbers derived from serial dilutions (10
 <sup>3</sup>–10
 <sup>9</sup> copies) of the plasmid. Each quantification was run in triplicates.
