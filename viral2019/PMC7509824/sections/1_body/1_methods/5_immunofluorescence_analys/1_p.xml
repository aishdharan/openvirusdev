<p id="Par31">Infected Vero E6 cells were seeded (5x10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in 8-well chamber slides (Becton–Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). Twenty-four h later, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS, and saturated with 3% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. For staining, cells were incubated overnight with a human serum containing IgG to SARS-CoV-2 (1:200 dilution) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-human IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino,2-phenylindole (DAPI, Merck). Cells were analyzed using a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) TCS SP5 laser scanning fluorescence microscope and the imaging software Leica Application Suite.
