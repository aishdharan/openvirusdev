<p id="Par33">Randomly amplified cDNA was generated using Sequence-independent Single-Primer Amplification (SISPA) Round A/B technique as described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, in Round A, RNA has been retrotranscribed with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using 40 pmol of Sol-PrimerA (5′-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-N9-3′). Second-strand DNA synthesis was obtained using Sequenase DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by incubating first strand cDNA at 37 °C for 8 min in 5 μl of Sequenase Mix #1 (1 μl 5 × Sequenase Buffer, 3.85 μl H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 0.15 μl Sequenase enzyme). To favour the complete second strand synthesis, 0.6 μl of Sequenase Mix #2 (0.45 μl Sequenase Dilution Buffer, 0.15 μl Sequenase Enzyme) was added to the previous mix and a further incubation at 37 °C for 8 min was performed. In round B reaction, 5 μl of Round A-labeled cDNA were subjected to amplification using AmpliTaq
 <sup>®</sup> Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 100 pmol Sol-PrimerB (5′-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-3′) in a 50 μl final volume. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s (40 cycles), 72 °C for 7 min. To maximize the recovery of fragments &gt; 200 bp, PCR products were purified using 1.8 × ratio AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter Inc., USA).
