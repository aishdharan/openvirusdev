<p id="Par34">Purified products were quantified using the Qubit
 <sup>®</sup> DNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), then genomic libraries were prepared using Nextera DNA Flex kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiniSeq
 <sup>®</sup> platform (Illumina) generating 2x150 bp paired-end reads. Raw data were checked for quality using FastQC (
