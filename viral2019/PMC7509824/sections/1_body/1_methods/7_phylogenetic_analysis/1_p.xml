<p id="Par36">Public SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences (&gt; 29 Kb), available up to June 2, 2020 were retrieved from the GISAID. Low-quality genomes and nearly identical sequences (genetic similarity &gt; 99.99%) were excluded, obtaining a global dataset of 3,171 public genomes plus the 2 novel genomes reported in this study. Sequences were aligned by MAFFT (FF-NS-2 algorithm) using default parameters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The alignment was manually curated to remove artifacts at the ends and within the alignment using Aliview [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using IQ-TREE (version 1.6.10) under the best fit model according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) indicated by the Model Finder application implemented in IQ-TREE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The statistical robustness of individual nodes was determined using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Lineages assessment was conducted using
