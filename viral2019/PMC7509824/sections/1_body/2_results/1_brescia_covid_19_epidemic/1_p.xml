<p id="Par39">We started to analyze nasopharyngeal swabs for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome from the Brescia region on February 28, 2020. From this date to May 31, we have analyzed a total of 40,730 samples and, among them, 11,344 samples (28.8%) were found positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, most of the positive samples were found in March (N = 8,398, 62.0% of the 13,547 analyzed), possibly representing the population that acquired the infection before a strict lock-down strategy was applied in Italy. Later on, positive cases were still present but the percentage of the SARS-CoV-2 positive samples among the total analyzed was drastically reduced. In May, only 611 out of 12,705 analyzed specimens (4.8%) were found positive. We also sought to evaluate if the two epidemic phases differed not only for number of positive cases but also, as recently observed in patients’ cohorts in Milan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], for amounts of detected viral RNA. To this aim, we analyzed Ct values observed in 100 randomly selected positive samples derived from the peak of epidemic (March 2020) and other 100 positive samples detected in May 2020. For each sample, we stratified Ct values observed for the 3 molecular targets detected by the Seegene diagnostic reagent (RdRP, E, N genes). Median Ct values for all the 3 target genes observed in March was significantly lower (E gene median Ct: 23.3, range 10.3-35.9; RdRP gene median Ct: 24.6, range 13.3-37.8; N gene median Ct: 25.3, range 13.9-38.3) than the median Ct values detected in samples collected in May (E gene median Ct: 32.1, range 11.6-45.0; RdRP gene median Ct: 34.0, range 13.9-38.6; N gene median Ct: 34.3, range 15.5-39.3) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In the later stage of epidemic one sample (GZ69), was strikingly different from all the other nasopharyngeal swabs analyzed. GZ69 specimen showed a very high amount of virus with Ct values (E gene Ct: 11.6; RdRP gene Ct: 13.9; N gene Ct: 15.5) that fell in the lower quartile of samples analyzed in the early epidemic period. Interestingly, GZ69 subject was completely asymptomatic being his sample obtained during a systematic healthcare workers screening on May 8.
