<p id="Par40">High viral load detected in GZ69 sample allowed us to isolate SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells. For comparison, we have also isolated a second virus (SARS-CoV-2 AP66), obtained from an age and gender-matched hospitalized patient infected in the early epidemic (March 9, 2020). AP66 sample showed a virus level superimposable to the amount of virus detected in GZ69 sample. AP66 sample Ct values were also comprised in the lower percentile of the early epidemic period (Fig.Â
