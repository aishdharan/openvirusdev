<p id="Par41">Surprisingly, the SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 isolate showed a much lower aggressiveness as compared to AP66. Indeed, as expected when samples’ SARS-CoV-2 viral load is very high, isolation of AP66 in Vero E6 (P
 <sub>0</sub>) led to a CPE appearance as early as 48 h post infection (p.i.), quickly spreading to the entire cell monolayer by 72 h p.i. On the contrary, despite comparable amounts of virus were present in AP66 and GZ69 specimens, Vero E6 viability was only slightly altered by GZ69 isolation, being CPE at 72 h p.i. limited to a few elements within a well-preserved cell monolayer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Interestingly, at 72 h p.i. (time 0, T
 <sub>0</sub>), no difference in the rescue of AP66 (5.2 x 10
 <sup>8</sup> genome copies/ml of cell culture supernatant) and GZ69 (3.8 x 10
 <sup>8</sup> genome copies/ml of cell culture supernatant) viral progenies was observed, thus excluding that lack of CPE in Vero E6 infected by GZ69 was due to an inefficient isolation process or to a slower viral replication kinetic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Monitoring of cells up to 8 days p.i. confirmed that infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 did not result in a clear CPE, thus suggesting that a persistent infection has been established. To confirm this hypothesis, cells were regularly split every 4 days up to passage 4 (P
 <sub>4</sub>) and cellular supernatants were collected prior to each cell subcultivation, from T
 <sub>1</sub> to T
 <sub>4</sub>. GZ69-infected Vero E6 cells rescued at each passage were largely viable (75-85%) and did not exhibit a slower growth in comparison to the not infected counterpart (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> c, d). Of note, a continuous release of SARS-CoV-2 GZ69, ranging from 1.4 x 10
 <sup>7</sup> to 3.8 x 10
 <sup>7</sup> genome copies/ml of cell culture supernatant, was also observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). This result shows that the absence of CPE in Vero E6 cells does not reflect the SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 replicative capacity.
