<p id="Par42">A Whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach was applied to evaluate if differences in CPE induced by SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 and SARS-CoV-2 AP66 were mirrored by genetic variations between the two isolates. Metagenomic sequencing of the isolates (T
 <sub>0</sub>) was performed using a MiniSeq Illumina platform. Raw sequence reads were trimmed for quality (Q &gt; 25) and length (&gt; 36 bp) and aligned to the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (Genbank accession number: NC_045512.2) using Bowtie2. Viral genome was covered at 99.9% for both isolates with no significative gaps observed in any coding positions. To analyze the GZ69 and AP66 SARS-CoV-2 genomes in a comprehensive phylogenetic context, we performed a maximum likelihood (ML) analysis on a dataset containing 3,171 sequences deposited in GISAID up to June 2, 2020. Our estimated ML phylogeny identified two major clades, lineages A and B as per the nomenclature recently proposed, branching at the root of the tree [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 AP66 isolate clustered in the B1 clade which includes most of the Italian sequences, together with sequences derived from other European countries and United States. The SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 genome sequence appeared, in contrast, to be located in a different cluster being assigned to SARS-CoV-2 sub-lineage B.1.1. Again, this recent sub-lineage mainly includes genome sequences from Italy, Europe and United States. In the tree, some sequences from other SARS-CoV-2 collected in Lombardy area, segregated in clusters different from those containing the two novel sequences characterized in this study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This suggests that, in this geographical area, multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have occurred through time.
