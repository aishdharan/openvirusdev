 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] showed that, with respect to the Wuhan-Hu-1 Reference Genome NC_045512.2, SARS-CoV-UNIBS-2 AP66 consensus sequence displayed 6 nucleotide substitutions (C241T; C3037T; C14408T; T21784G; C21846T; A23403G) leading to 4 non-synonymous changes (ORF1ab polypeptide: P4715L; S protein: N74K, T95I, D614G). Three out of 6 nucleotide substitutions reside within the gene encoding the S protein and all of them gave origin to non-synonymous amino acid changes. The other non-synonymous substitution observed is located at the ORF1ab coding region, within the RdRP domain. This mutation (P4715L), together with the D614G in the S protein, are recurrent mutations that have emerged in Europe starting from February 2020 as recently clearly described by Pachetti et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In agreement with this finding, mutations at nt positions 14,408 and 23,403 were present also in the late (May 2020) SARS-CoV-2-UNIBS-GZ69 viral variant. Less pathogenic GZ69 consensus sequence differed from Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate in 11 nucleotide positions (C241T; C2939T; C3037T; C3828T; C14408T; A23403G; T24631C; G28881A; G28882A; G28883C; G29810T) and 6 of them were non-synonymous (ORF1ab polypeptide: P892S, S1188L, P4715L; S protein D614G; N Protein: R203K, G204R). Interestingly, SARS-CoV2-UNIBS-GZ69 consensus differed from the early SARS-CoV-2-UNIBS-AP66 variant in 9 positions (C2939T; C3828T; G21784T; T21846C; T24631C; G28881A; G28882A; G28883C; G29810T) and these genetic variations have led to 4 non-synonymous substitutions in the ORF1ab (P892S, S1188L), in the S protein (K74N, I95T) and in the N protein (R203K, G204R) (Fig.Â
