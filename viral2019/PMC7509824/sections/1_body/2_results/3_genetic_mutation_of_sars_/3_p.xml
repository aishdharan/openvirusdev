<p id="Par44">To exclude that the mutations observed in the SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 isolate were introduced during viral replication in vitro we have performed WGS directly on GZ69 nasopharyngeal swab. In comparison to Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, consensus sequence of ex vivo GZ69 nasopharyngeal sample showed the same 11 nucleotide substitutions identified in the SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 isolate. Of note, substitutions identified at each nucleotide position in the GZ69 clinical sample were present in 100% of the reads analyzed, thus excluding that in vitro isolation may have selected a single SARS-CoV-2 intra-host variant.</p>
