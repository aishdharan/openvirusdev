<p id="Par47">Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 S gene have been correlated with its attenuation or enhanced aggressiveness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In agreement with the evidence that SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 isolate showed no relevant impairment in infectivity, we observed that it maintained a “wild type” S sequence; the fixed “european” D614G substitution was, in fact, the only difference detected with respect to Wuhan reference strain. Comparison between the SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 and SARS-CoV-2 AP66 sequences revealed the presence of 4 more non-synonymous substitutions. Mutations at amino acid residues 892 (P to S) and 1188 (S to L) have not yet been described worldwide. They both reside within the large nsp3, whose mutational events have been considered a potential mechanism differentiating COVID-19 from SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In particular, mutation S1188L is comprised within the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain (Mac1, residues 1023-1197 of polyprotein 1a), a domain that is present in all coronaviruses. Mac1 binds and removes ADP-ribose from post-translationally modified cellular proteins and this activity counteracts host antiviral ADP-ribosylation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Remarkably, Mac1 mutation in SARS-CoV does not interfere with virus replication in Vero E6 cell cultures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] but mutant virus is highly attenuated in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. These results attest that SARS-CoV Mac1 is largely dispensable for viral replication but is required for the pathogenesis and likely promotes virulence by countering the mammalian innate immune response. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the mutation observed in Mac1 of SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 may take part in different CPE induced on Vero E6 described herein.
