<p id="Par50">The identification of the peculiar SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 strain in the late epidemic highlights the need to better characterize viral variants circulating among asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals. This will allow to identify critical genetic mutations that might be a part of the viral adaptation process eventually leading to changes in virus pathogenicity. This distinct outcome could be used to search for host gene expression and/or signaling pathways playing a role in the establishment of viral persistence. Taken together, these results could pave the way to future studies aimed at analyzing the selection process favouring viral mutations in the human host. </p>
