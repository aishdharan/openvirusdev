<p>Since 2013, we have focused on HAdV-associated urethritis and performed pathogen screening from the urine of all-male patients with acute urethritis at iClinic in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan; all patients gave informed consent (reference 
 <italic>16</italic> in 
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref>). Recently, several papers have reported that HAdVs are ranked the third- or fourth-highest causative agents of nonchlamydial, nongonococcal urethritis (reference 
 <italic>17</italic> in Appendix). Furthermore, HAdVs most commonly associated with urethritis are those that cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, which are types D37, D56, and D64 (references
