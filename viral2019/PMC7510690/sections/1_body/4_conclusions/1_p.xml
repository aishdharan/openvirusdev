<p>HAdVs infect mucous membranes and can infect the urethra. Documented cases of HAdV urethritis are most often associated with certain species D HAdVs that cause epidemic keratoconjuctivitis (references 
 <italic>16–18</italic> in Appendix). Our finding of HAdV-B7d, a virus more commonly associated with acute respiratory infections, in this patient was unexpected. Although we identified 
 <italic>H. parainfluenza</italic> from urethral discharge at the first clinic visit, we suspect that it may have contributed to but not caused the patient’s primary symptoms. The isolated HAdV-B7d strains in this study were excreted in urine and gargle for 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1 week after all symptoms had disappeared (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), which suggests that HAdV-B7d infection may cause urethritis and involve viral shedding into urine.
