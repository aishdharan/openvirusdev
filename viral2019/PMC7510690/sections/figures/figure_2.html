 <caption> Phylogenetic analysis of human adenovirus genome type 7 whole-genome sequencing in study of human adenovirus B7dâ€“associated urethritis, Japan. We isolated 293 strain and compared it with other human adenovirus type 7 reference strains. We aligned genomic sequences using ClustalW ( http://www.clustal.org) and constructed the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree using MEGA version 7.0 software ( https://megasoftware.net). Numbers at selected nodes indicate level of support using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Scale bar indicates the estimated number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Sequence names are derived from the GenBank accession number, geographic location, and year of sample collection and virus type. </caption>
