 <p>We estimated the weighted mean basic reproduction number (R
  <sub>0</sub>) of chikungunya virus based on outbreak size. R
  <sub>0</sub> was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4–4.2) and varied for 2 primary chikungunya mosquito vectors: 4.1 (95% CI 1.5–6.6) for 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 2.8 (95% CI 1.8–3.8) for 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>.
