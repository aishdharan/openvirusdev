<p>The basic reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) of an infection is the mean number of secondary cases a single infectious person causes in a completely susceptible population. The magnitude of R
 <sub>0</sub> is used to measure the risk and spread of an epidemic or pandemic. To control an outbreak, the R
 <sub>0</sub> should be reduced to 
 <underline>&lt;</underline>1 through interventions, such as vaccination. Because little information is available at the beginning of an epidemic, the estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> commonly is used to assess public health preparedness needs, the impact of the possible epidemic, and success of the control measures. Information on R
 <sub>0</sub> often is lacking for emerging diseases like chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral disease of humans and nonhuman primates.
