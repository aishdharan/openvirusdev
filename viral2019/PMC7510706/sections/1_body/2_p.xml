<p>CHIKV outbreaks were reported from &gt;100 countries worldwide during 2014–2019 (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>2</italic>
 </xref>). Epidemiologic understanding of CHIKV changed after outbreaks on the island of La Réunion in the Indian Ocean during 2005–2006, when 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes were identified as the outbreak vector (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>,
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>3</italic>
 </xref>). The global expansion of CHIKV partially is attributed to viral adaptation to this new mosquito vector, which facilitated a mutation in the coding for the envelop protein 1 A226V (E1-A226V) gene of CHIKV, increasing the competence of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes to transmit the virus from mosquitoes to humans (

 </xref>–
