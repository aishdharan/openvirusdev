<p>The authors estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> by using mathematical (compartmental) models fitted with respective outbreak data (

 </xref>â€“
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). We considered the estimated values comparable and extracted the R
 <sub>0</sub> from each. We then estimated the weighted mean R
 <sub>0</sub> of CHIKV based on outbreak size, such as number of reported cases included in the estimation of R
 <sub>0</sub> in the original article, and further estimated the mean R
 <sub>0</sub> for different mosquito vectors and E1-A226V gene mutations.
