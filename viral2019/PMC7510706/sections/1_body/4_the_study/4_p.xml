<p>We estimated the weighted mean R
 <sub>0</sub> of CHIKV to be 3.4 (95% CI 2.4–4.2). We analyzed the data and estimated the R
 <sub>0</sub> for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes separately for outbreaks in which the R
 <sub>0</sub> of CHIKV was described for each species. We estimated the R
 <sub>0</sub> to be 4.1 (95% CI 1.5–6.6) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and 2.8 (95% CI 1.8–3.8) for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Although the difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.12), we expected a lower R
 <sub>0</sub> for outbreaks involving 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes because this species also feeds on animals, which might have reduced the attack rate on humans and transmission across the population. However, outbreaks associated with 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes can be prolonged and the outbreak response can have economic consequences. We estimated the R
 <sub>0</sub> to be 3.5 (95% CI 1.9–4.9) during outbreaks involving the E1-A226V mutation, which is higher than R
 <sub>0</sub> of 2.1 from the 2017 outbreak in Italy that did not have the gene mutation.
