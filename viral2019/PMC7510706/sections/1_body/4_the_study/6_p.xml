<p>In a study in Brazil, 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>68% of persons with CHIKV remained chronically infected for up to 1 year (

 </xref>). On RÃ©union Island, a small group of patients had clinical signs for 6 years. Although the reason for persistence is unclear, it might be strain related and associated with the E1-A226V mutation. Therefore, despite being less severe and causing fewer deaths than other mosquitoborne diseases, CHIKV can have lingering physical and psychological consequences for those affected. Infected persons also can experience economic consequences because they might not be able to work for several weeks or more.
