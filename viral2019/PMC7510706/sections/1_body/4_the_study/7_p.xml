<p>R
 <sub>0</sub> does not remain constant. For arboviruses, R
 <sub>0</sub> can vary based on the density of hosts and vectors; mosquito species, survival, and biting rate; and vector competence and capacity, all of which can depend on environmental and microclimatic factors. Further, the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes for CHIKV might be different from that for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, which could influence outbreak dynamics. For example, 1 study reported the transmission efficiency of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes as 97% and of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes as 83% (
