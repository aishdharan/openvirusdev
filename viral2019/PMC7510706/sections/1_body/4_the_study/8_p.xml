<p>The outbreaks included in our study occurred in tropical and subtropical countries and in the more temperate climate of Italy. We did not consider climatic conditions during reported outbreaks, which might play a role in determining the size and R
 <sub>0</sub> of CHIKV outbreaks. We also did not consider the variation of data quality in published articles, except for the outbreak size, which might affect estimated R
 <sub>0</sub>. However, defining adjustments for data quality would have been difficult and might have introduced unwanted bias.
