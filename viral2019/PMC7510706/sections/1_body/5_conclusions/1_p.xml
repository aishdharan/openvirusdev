<p>We found the overall mean R
 <sub>0</sub> for CHIKV was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4–4.2). Our estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> of 4.1 (95% CI 1.5–6.6) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes suggests CHIKV could spread rapidly and cause high disease incidence in urban areas, where this species thrives. Our estimated CHIKV R
 <sub>0</sub> for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes of 2.8 (95% CI 1.5–6.6) was lower than for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. In rural areas, where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes are more prevalent, sylvatic cycles, maintenance of biodiversity including natural mosquito populations, and presence of hosts other than humans might reduce the effects of an outbreak. Early interventions targeting 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes will be vital to controlling CHIKV outbreaks.
