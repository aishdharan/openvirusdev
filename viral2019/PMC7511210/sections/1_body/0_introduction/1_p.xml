<p id="par0025">The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, which apparently started in December 2019 in China (

Furthermore, we and others have shown that detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children is rare, as are clinical cases (

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2020</xref>), respectively. The fate of this epidemic remains unknown, but we found it interesting to compare the age and weekly distribution of the five human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that circulated in southeastern France in order to compare the temporal and age distribution of these different viruses.
