<p id="par0035">First, we analyzed all available diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses for 141,227 patients. Between January and May 2020, we tested respiratory samples from 80,024 patients for SARS-CoV-2 and found 6,735 (8.4%) positive (

Of these, 17,673 were tested for endemic coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1) and 1,156 (6.5%) were positive. For SARS-CoV-2, positive children under 15 years represented 3.4% (228/6,735) of all positive patients. This proportion was significantly lower than that for endemic coronaviruses (46.1%; 533/1,156; p &lt; 0.001, Chi–square test). In fact, positive patients in each group 0−1 year, 1−5 years, 5−10 years, and 10−15 years represented significantly lower proportions of all positive patients when comparing SARS-CoV-2 to other endemic coronavirus infections (
