<p id="par0040">Second, we analyzed 10,026 patients who were tested for both SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses between January 1st and May 25th, 2020. A total of 1,067 patients (10.6%) were SARS-CoV-2- positive, and 445 (4.4%) were diagnosed with endemic coronaviruses. Children under 15 years of age accounted for a significantly lower proportion of all positive cases for SARS-CoV-2 than for endemic coronaviruses [2.2% (24/1,067) vs. 33.5% (149/445), respectively; p &lt; 0.001] as was the case in each age group: 0−1 year, 1−5 years, 5−10 years and 10−15 years (

They represented a significantly lower proportion than the proportion of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients among those negative for endemic coronaviruses [11/445 (2.5%) vs 1,056/9,581 (11.0%); p &lt; 0.001]. None of these eleven patients was under 18 years of age.
