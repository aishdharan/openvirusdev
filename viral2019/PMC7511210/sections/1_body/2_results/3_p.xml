<p id="par0045">Moreover, over one year (from June 2019 to May 2020), we observed that epidemic curves were comparable for the four endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Cases of endemic coronavirus increased in December 2019, peaked in mid-March 2020, and ended in early April, while cases of SARS-CoV-2 increased in early March, peaked in late March, and nearly ended in mid-May. The fitted distributions reflected three kinds of epidemic curves (Supplementary Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2 fitted with a left-skewed Gamma distribution (AIC = 26345.6). HCoV-OC43 fitted with a quasi-symmetric curve and Normal distribution (AIC = 971.4). Epidemic curves of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 were right-skewed and fitted with a Gompertz distribution (AIC = 394.5, 1191.2, and 1861.2, respectively).
