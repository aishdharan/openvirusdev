<p id="par0055">Overall, we believe that this work contributes to the understanding of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, which has a temporal distribution resembling that of endemic coronaviruses but an age distribution that largely spares the youngest subjects, who are precisely those the most frequently exposed to endemic coronaviruses and may have consequently acquired protective immunity. Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly perhaps reflects the loss of immunity acquired during childhood or changes in social organization that occurred during recent decades. Indeed, a small proportion of people over the age of 50 lived in communities with very young children, whereas womenâ€™s work evolution has led to much earlier socialization of children. Finally, the fact that age distributions for infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses differ, underscores that real data collection and real-time analysis are critical in the event of an outbreak to decipher the epidemiology of emerging pathogens.</p>
