<p id="p0030">Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks of acute respiratory diseases and their phase differences at different latitudes on the Earth (e.g.

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Subbarao, 1999</xref>) manifest mainly through “antigenic drift,” the property of such viruses to mutate rapidly (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Agranovski et al., 2004</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). For A and B influenza viruses, such mutations develop at rates of 6.7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> and 3.2 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> nucleotide substitution per site per year, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lofgren et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McCullers et al., 1999</xref>). These imply, on average, 6 and 3 mutations per RNA segment of each virus every 6 months, respectively, sufficient (especially for type-A influenza) to trigger recurrences of epidemics on antigenic-drift timescale. However, without an external forcing mechanism, such recurring events are typically of modest intensity, can only last for a few cycles, and most importantly are not able to reproduce the observed phase shift between the north and south hemisphere on the Earth.
