<p id="p0040">Most of these, however, modulate on timescales that are either typical of seasons on the Earth or longer and thus singularly can only explain some aspects of seasonality of recurring outbreaks, or the onsets of particularly violent outbreaks. For example, the load of air-travel flow is typically larger during northern hemisphere summers, and this is in contrast with most of the outbreaks developing during falls and winters in these countries. On the other hand, vastly populated areas in the north hemisphere lie at relatively lowÂ latitudes in temperate regions where indoor heating is not massively widespread: yet, even in these areas, influenza epidemics typically develop during winters and remain inactive in summers. Similarly, temperature, humidity, and air pollution are not homogeneously distributed through the planet, and micro-climate can vary substantially at the same latitude, depending on the particular geographical or industrial setting of even contiguous areas. The cross-influence of all these factors could certainly synergize to produce the observed geographical and time modulations, but this would require a hard-to-obtain perfect fine-tuning of the many parameters at play.</p>
