<p id="p0055">For the solar virus-inactivation mechanism to be effective in modulating the disease's transmission and settling the duration and recurrence of epidemics, both direct contact (e.g. through exposed surfaces) and airborne transmission have to play a role. This is indeed the case for most respiratory diseases (e.g. 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Prather et al., 2020</xref> and references therein). Additionally, the time needed for aerosol particles to gravitationally settle has to be comparable or longer than the typical UV-B/UV-A virus's lethal time (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nicastro et al., 2020</xref>, submitted). This is probably not true (in still air) for the largest (∼100 μm in size) and thus heaviest droplets produced in coughs and sneezes, where the gravitational settling time is of the order of few seconds (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Morawska and Cao, 2020</xref>), but can certainly be the case for significantly smaller, micron or sub-micron size, aerosol particles (like those that commonly contain the influenza virus, e.g. 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Tellier et al., 2019</xref>) that can survive in still air for longer than 12.4 hr (
