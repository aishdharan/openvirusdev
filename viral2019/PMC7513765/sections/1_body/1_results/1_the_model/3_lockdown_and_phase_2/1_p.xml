<p id="p0080">Lockdown and phase 2 terms are modeled with exponential functions (see Methods in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="fn">Supplementary Information</xref>) that act as attenuation (lockdown) and amplification (phase 2) factors of the reproductive number R
 <sub>t</sub>, with, respectively, halving and doubling times (in units of 1Â day) that are free parameters of the model. The lockdown attenuation ends when phase 2 starts, and phase 2 amplification ends when R
 <sub>t</sub> reaches the original value R
 <sub>0</sub> characteristic of the disease.
