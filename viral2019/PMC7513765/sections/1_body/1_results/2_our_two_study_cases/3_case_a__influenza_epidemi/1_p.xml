 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the curves of growth of the infected individuals in the three latitude groups over the first 20 years of influenza epidemics with (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) and without (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) solar pump (see caption for details). When the solar pump is not active (ε = 0; 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C), the growth (and decline) of epidemics proceeds identically at all latitudes (black, blue, and orange curves are superimposed to each other). The period of oscillations, in this case, resonates solely with the inverse of the LOI rate (the time it takes for previously infected individuals to become again susceptible), the strength of epidemics declines from cycle to cycle, and the disease dies out completely in less than 10 years. When the solar pump is active (ε = 1; 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), instead, the reproductive number undergoes small infra-day variations (whose exact magnitude depends on the particular time of the year and Earth's latitude, other than the efficiency of the solar-pump mechanism: e.g. onsets of 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) that do not significantly change its daily average value (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), but progressively drive the modulation of epidemic oscillations to match the seasonal solar period (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). The north (black), south (blue), and tropical (orange) groups differentiate immediately, and after a few cycles (lasting a total of about 5 years) are perfectly regulated on biannual periodicity, with phase shifted in time by 6 months in the northern versus southern hemisphere and the tropical group undergoing fast and continuous moderate bursts of epidemics roughly every six months. The biannual oscillations at latitudes ±40° last for a few tens of years and then synchronize with the yearly solar-irradiation seasonal period (see figure's caption for details). The cycles can run unperturbed for centuries, as shown in the Susceptible versus Infected (S–I) phase diagrams of 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B, where the first 100 years of endemic diseases are drawn (see figure's caption for details).
