 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> show analogous figures for the cases with γ
 <sub>in</sub> = 0.0055 (5-year period of recurrence: 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and γ
 <sub>in</sub> = 0 (no LOI: 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, when the solar pump is active and LOI periods are long compared to the seasonal period (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B), oscillations are more erratic and chaotic during the long settling period (initial cycles cover a wide dynamical range in the S–I phase diagram of 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Destructive resonance between the LOI rate and the solar cycles acts differently in the three latitude groups, and if no group mixing is introduced (and with this particular set of model parameters), the intense bursts of epidemics in the northern hemisphere are initially separated by the inverse of LOI rate (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). This separation progressively squeezes at all latitudes as the continuous solar pumping imposes its rhythm and becomes strictly seasonal at all latitudes in about 40–50 years. The squeezing of the time intervals between outbreaks is visible also when the solar pump is not active (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). This is because, as new outbreaks develop, the reservoir of susceptible individuals made available by previous LOI cycles and the number of people still infected at any time are sufficient to trigger new bursts at earlier times. However, in this case, the strength of each outbreak decreases smoothly and systematically with years, and in about 70 years, the reservoir of susceptible individuals at each time completely empties and the epidemics die out (Fig, 4c and 4d). Moreover, again, the three latitude groups behave identically, which is not observed.
