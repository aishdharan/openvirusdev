<p id="p0125">The sun has also the effect of reducing by almost one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, the number of infected individuals observed from February through May, in the South and tropical groups, with respect to the North group, which is exactly what has generally been observed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). The curve of growth of the South group, however, starts climbing again in March–April (which has generally been observed, e.g. 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nicastro et al., 2020</xref>, submitted) and, if no additional distancing measures are adopted, should have a second and higher peak in October, toward the end of the South winter (
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A). In the northern hemisphere, instead, this simulation (but see below for alternative scenarios) predicts that the curves of growth of the epidemics reach a minimum in June–July (as indeed observed in Italy: 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A), start climbing again (less aggressively than during the initial January outbreak) from August through October and, in the absence of new distancing measures, reach a new intense peak in November, while tropical countries will see a second and much stronger outbreak during the second half of 2020 and through January–February 2021. Subsequently, under these conditions, the epidemics will start adjusting to the solar cycle and less aggressive outbreaks (maximum daily number of new infected individuals between ten and forty thousand) will repeat cyclically for tens of years (
