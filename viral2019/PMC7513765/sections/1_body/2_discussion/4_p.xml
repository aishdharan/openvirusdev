<p id="p0155">An additional way of assessing the relative importance, if not the exact magnitude, of the solar-pump mechanism versus other external forcing mechanisms will be to compare the evolution of the epidemic in Italy over the next several months with model predictions. The three curves of 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> differ substantially in short- and long-term predictions of the evolution of the epidemic. In all cases, Italy, where distancing measures have now greatly being relaxed, should start seeing a strong increase in the number of new daily infected in September, and this should continue, in the absence of distancing measures, through the end of November 2020 for maximum solar-pump efficiency (red curve) and through mid January 2021 for low solar-pump efficiency (ε ≤ 0.3: green and blue curves). Moreover, at low solar-pump efficiencies (green and blue curves), the number of daily infected shall start climbing again around late spring 2021 and then again, roughly every six months for a few additional cycles, dictated only by the LOI rate (γ
 <sub>in</sub> = 0.0055 in these simulations) and until the solar mechanism starts differentiating the green from the blue curve. On the contrary, at maximum solar-pump efficiency (red curve), contagions will not be able to spread again till late summer 2021 and then will adjust to seasonal cycles.
