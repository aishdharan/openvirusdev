<p id="p0160">Finally, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, at each given time, the solar-pump mechanism acts differently at different latitudes on the Earth. Thus, comparing our model predictions with SARS-CoV-2 data in countries located at opposite latitudes over the next few months should also tell us quantitatively about the importance of the solar-pump effect in modulating the spreading of this disease.
