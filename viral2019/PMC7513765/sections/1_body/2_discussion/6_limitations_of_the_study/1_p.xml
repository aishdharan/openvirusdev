<p id="p0165">Our model for the diffusion of contagions (see Methods in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="fn">Supplementary Information</xref>) considers population groups as ideal isolated systems (i.e. no cross-mixing of populations in different groups at different latitudes on the Earth). This condition is certainly not verified in today's global world, in which daily exchange of people and goods are massive and, generally, not strictly controlled (unless measures to limit the spread of contagions are taken by governments, as in the case of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemics). This type of complexity could easily be introduced in our basic system of differential equations (see Methods in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="fn">Supplementary Information</xref>) by considering cross-mixing through a matrix of either observed (i.e. based on air-, ground-, and sea-traffic data) or randomized exchange rates of susceptible and infected individuals among groups. However, the introduction of such an additional degree of complexity in the model (which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper), while could contribute to wash out and partially homogenize differences between specific groups at different latitudes, could hardly build up or break the strict seasonality that is typically observed in the recurrence of respiratory diseases and whose explanation is the main scope of this work.
