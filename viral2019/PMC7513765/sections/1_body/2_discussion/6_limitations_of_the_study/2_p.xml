<p id="p0170">The basic ingredient of our model that generates seasonality and latitude-dependent phase differences among groups is a physically motivated resonant forcing mechanism (the solar pump) that acts as a daily modulator of the reproductive number R
 <sub>t</sub> (see Methods in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="fn">Supplementary Information</xref>). The mechanism is based on the virus-inactivation power of the solar UV photons that reach the Earth's surface and is dictated by the shapes of the daily solar irradiation curves on Earth, which, for a given latitude and time of the year, depend only on the Earth's spinning around its rotation axis and whose self-similarity throughout a solar year is determined only by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. However, the exact efficiency of this mechanism depends on the quantification of several intrinsic parameters of the specific epidemic, such as the lethal dose of UV photons needed to inactivate the specific virus when exposed to solar-like spectra, the average lifetime of the virus in aerosol or surfaces, its transport in wind or low-atmosphere currents, etc. The quantification of these parameters for given viruses is beyond the scope of this work, whose aim is to show the potential of solar radiation in modulating the short- and long-term evolution of epidemics outbreaks and demonstrate that the unavoidable, infra-day (minute timescales) resonant mechanism naturally offered by the solar-pump can efficiently synchronize with internal LOI rates to explain the course of epidemics on much longer timescales.
