<p id="p0175">Related to the above caveat, the efficiency of the solar-pump mechanism, which can only act on outdoor droplets generated through speaking, coughing, and/or sneezing aerosol and surfaces-deposited particles, depends also on the social habits of different population groups, located even at similar latitudes on the Earth, often dictated by climate, and on specific location's weather (e.g. diffuse cloud coverage). For example, outdoor living, even in winters, is much more common in Mediterranean countries than in North American states at similar Earth's latitudes. This is often anti-correlated with the massive use of indoor air-conditioning (offices, shopping malls, private homes, private and public transportation, etc.), which is known to be an efficient mean of diffusion of contagions and could, for example, contribute to explaining why the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics has spread aggressively during the initial part of summer in northern locations like the State of Texas in the US. Similarly, the diffuse cloud coverage (especially during the times of the days when the solar irradiation is maximum) in tropical countries, during specific times of the year (e.g. the monsoon season in India, or the rain seasons in the northern of Brazil, or hurricane seasons in central and tropical America) will reduce the efficiency of the solar pump and could act as an amplifier of the growth of contagions in specific periods of the year. Again, the consideration of such additional degrees of complexity in the model is certainly possible but would require a somewhat arbitrary (if not based on solid social and weather data) introduction of group-dependent weights in the parameterization of the efficiency of the solar-pump mechanism, which is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
