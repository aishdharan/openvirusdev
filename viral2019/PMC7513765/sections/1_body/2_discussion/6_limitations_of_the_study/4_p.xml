<p id="p0180">Finally, we stress that the large number of parameters of the model together with the degeneracy of some of these parameters make it difficult to exactly quantify the relative importance of the solar-pump mechanism in epidemics with high intrinsic reproductive number and for which eternal forcing mechanisms like lockdown and phase 2 are introduced. As discussed in the session above, the epidemics starting time in the model is strongly degenerate with the under-sampling factor (the ratio between actual infections and detected cases), the efficiency of the solar pump, and, more moderately, the starting date of adoption of distancing measures. The exact shape of the declining and recovery phases of the curves of growth of the epidemics, when distancing measures are in effect and after they are relieved, also influence the proper modeling of actual epidemics data. In our model we assume that during these two phases, the contact rate (and so R
 <sub>t</sub>) evolves exponentially, with one single halving and doubling time, respectively (see Methods in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="fn">Supplementary Information</xref>). This does not have to be (and most likely is not) the case, practically. Measures adopted can (and most often do) vary on the go, and this implies either different functional shapes or variable halving/doubling times within the same phase. Such complexity introduces degeneracies between the exponential halving and doubling times and the starting dates of lockdown and phase 2 in the model, when modeling global data over externally controlled declining and recovering phases. A data-driven modeling approach to the problem, together with an accurate knowledge of all observables of the epidemics, are the only way to break these degeneracies without increasing the degree of complexity of the model (which, in turn, would introduce additional degrees of degeneracy).
