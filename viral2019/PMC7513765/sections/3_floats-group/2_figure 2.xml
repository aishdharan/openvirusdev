  <p>Efficiency of the Solar Pump</p>
  <p>One-day-averaged reproductive number Rt as a function of time (in days) over one full solar year and at a 40° north location on the Earth, attenuated only by the solar-pump mechanism with efficiencies of ε = 0.3 (green curves) and ε = 1 (blue curves), starting from an epidemic-intrinsic R
   <sub>0</sub> = 3 value. Onsets show the daily attenuation curves as a function of day time in hours during the first and the 180
   <sup>th</sup> day of the year (January 1
   <sup>st</sup> and July 1
   <sup>st</sup>, respectively).
