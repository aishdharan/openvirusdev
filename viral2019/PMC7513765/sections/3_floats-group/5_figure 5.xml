When internal dynamics is absent (no LOI), the epidemics cannot become endemic. However, when the solar pump is active (ε = 1; [A and B]), UV photons from the sun are able to modulate the outbreak and prolong it for a few cycles. A couple of bursts are seen at ±40°, whereas a single long, mild, and Sun-modulated epidemics develops at the equator and last for about 6 years. Without solar pump (ε = 0; [C and D]), a single intense episode is seen at all latitudes. With epidemics starting during northern hemisphere winters (as in our models), latitude +40° reaches a maximum infected over susceptible fraction of 1%, while this fraction is four times larger at −40° and about ten times smaller at the equator (B).
