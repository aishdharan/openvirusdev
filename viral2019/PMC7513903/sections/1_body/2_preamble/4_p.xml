 </sup>. This environment could be considered an altered ecosystem, or better, an 
 <italic>amplification effect</italic> zone, where an high density of pathogensâ€™ reservoirs and sensible hosts are forced into atypical interactions, and where the 
 <italic>dilution effect</italic> found in nature is abolished, with higher possibility of the development of outbreaks. In this 
 <italic>altered ecosystem</italic>, humans play the part of susceptible hosts who can be infected either indirectly through an intermediate host, or directly from the reservoir. In the latter option, humans circulating in the wet-markets could become intermediate hosts of their own population. This point will be discussed in more detail later on.
