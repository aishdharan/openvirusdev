<p id="Par15">Once arrived in the new environment (human or intermediate host), pathogens such as viruses may acquire new genes or modify existing genes e.g., by genetic recombination: in coronaviruses the rate is of the order of 1 per 10,000 nucleotides, which makes these RNA viruses especially conducive to host switching. In this way, virus variants with higher transmissibility or pathogenicity will emerge

 </sup>. Initially, there could be repeated transmissions of the virus from animals to humans, without a human-to-human transmission, that are defined as

 <italic>amplification effect</italic> of the wet-markets could increase the rate of the 
 <italic>viral chatters</italic> boosting the diversity of the virus variants, leading the pathogens to adapt to humans, and favoring their spread in the population. If the 
 <italic>amplification effect</italic> is absent, only limited outbreaks are likely to occur, which will remain undetected or confined to remote locations from which the large scale spreading of the infection will not be possible. This is would appear to have repeatedly happened to the COVID-19 prior to the Wuhan explosion.
