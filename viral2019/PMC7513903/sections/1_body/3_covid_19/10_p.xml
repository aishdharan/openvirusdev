<p id="Par25">The cleavage of the S protein is performed by proteases of the host cell, both endosomal, cathepsins B and L, and the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2, which appears to predominate

 </sup>. Another protease, the furin is also active in the cleavage of the S-protein, possibly preparing it for the cleavage by TMPRSS2

 </sup>. The two segments of the cleaved S protein remain bound non-covalently, and the binding of the RBD of S1 to the receptor weakens the non-covalent interactions between the two segments. This step exposes the fusion peptide within the S2 segment, promoting its insertion into the cell membrane and the eventual internalization of the virus. The virus can also become internalized by endocytosis, i.e., the membrane of the target cell folds around it to form an endosome. The endosome eventually fuses with the lysosomes, where the hydrolases uncoat the virion liberating its RNA genome in the cytoplasma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The RNA genome is translated in polyproteins, among which proteases cleave them into non structural proteins (nsp 1â€“16), of which the nsp 12 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that replicates the RNA genome and catalyzes the synthesis of the viral structural proteins.
