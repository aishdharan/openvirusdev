<p id="Par26">Coronavirus genomes (26â€“32 kilobases) are the largest known RNA genomes, their expansion being due to the acquisition of specific enzyme functions that counter the otherwise very high error frequency of the RNA polymerase (see Box 
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). The nsp12 is the central enzyme of the replicase gene in all RNA viruses. It contains the canonical RNA- dependent RNA polymerase motifs in its C-terminal portion, and catalyzes the synthesis of the viral RNA. Its function requires accessory proteins (nsp 7 and nsp 8). The replicase complex of the coronaviruses has special properties such as the strong influence of the accessory proteins (nsp) on its behavior, the high RNA recombination frequency, and the complexity of the subgenomic mRNA synthesis

 </sup>. The 3D structure of the RNA polymerase has now been solved in two variants: one in a complex with the nsp7, and nsp8 proteins; and one in a complex with a nsp 8 monomer

 </sup>. The 3D structure of the polymerase has also been solved in a complex with one of its inhibitors, remdesivir: a phosphoramidate adenosine analog that is processed within the cell to a nucleoside triphosphate derivative that can become integrated into the viral RNA

 </sup>. Once reconstituted, the virion eventually leaves the host cell by exocytosis to attack neighboring targets, i.e., macrophages and T-lymphocytes. One of the structural proteins of the virion, nucleocapsid protein N, catalyzes the synthesis of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) by binding to NF-kB on the promoter of the IL-6 gene. IL-6 is the principal actor in the cytokine storm triggered by the coronavirus
