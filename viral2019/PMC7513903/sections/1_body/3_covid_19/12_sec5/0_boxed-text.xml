 <p id="Par27">The RNA synthesis and processing function—the 
  <italic>replicase gene</italic>—occupy about two thirds of the genome. Its tracslation products are two large polyproteins, which are cleaved to a number of non structural proteins (nsp 1 to 16). The cleavage is performed by two cysteine proteases, a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), and a papain-like protease (PLpro), which is the target of interesting inhibitors. In addition to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (nsp 12) the replication and transcription process (the replicase gene) also contains the helicase (nsp 13) and a number of other nsps that act on the mRNA. Together with other nsps, all these proteins constitute the “
  <italic>nps interactome</italic>”.
