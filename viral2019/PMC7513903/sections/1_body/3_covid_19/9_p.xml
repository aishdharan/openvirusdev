<p id="Par24">The COVID-19 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) contains four structural proteins that are encoded by open reading frames (ORF) at the 3′end of the RNA genome, and 16 accessory proteins (nsp 1 to nsp 16), which are encoded by other ORFs at its 5′end. The structural proteins E and M form the envelope of the virus, the N protein nucleocapsid binds the viral RNA, and the S glycoprotein interacts with the receptor of the target cells favoring the virus penetration into them. During the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002–2003, this receptor was identified as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

 </sup> (Fig.

 </sup>. After passing the ER quality control, the S protein is transported to the surface of the virus and is incorporated into the viral membrane where it is cleaved (primed) into two segments: (1) the N-terminal S1 segment contains a signal peptide and the receptor binding domain (RBD) that interact with the host cell receptor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)
 <sup>

 </sup>; (2) the S2 segment, which anchors the S protein to the viral membrane, and contains the fusion peptide which mediates the fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane of the target cell. A loop subdomain (RBM) in the RBD contacts directly the receptor
