<p id="Par29">In 2013, diverse SARS-like-CoVs were discovered in a single colony of 
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic> in Yunnan Province (China). The colony contained CoVs with all genetic diversity encountered in other locations in China

 </sup>, and the viral strains presented all genetic elements needed to form SARS-CoV
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. During the same study, a new isolate of SARS-like-CoV, termed W1V1, was also identified with 95% nucleotide sequence identity, to that of human SARS-CoV, i.e., higher than in other SARS-like-CoVs, and able to use ACE2 receptors of different origin as cell entry path
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. The new isolate was indeed able to replicate efficiently in ACE2-expressing cells, and to grow in human alveolar basal epithelial cells. Its close genetic relation to human SARS-CoV was confirmed by the neutralization effect of convalescent SARS patients sera on WIV1

 </sup>. The high genetic diversity of SARS-like-CoVs within this bat colony was mirrored by high phenotypic diversity in the differential use of ACE2 by different strains. The identification of WIV1-CoV, and its ability to use ACE2 orthologs posed a warning for possible reemergence of a CoV outbreak

 </sup>. On the basis of this premise, Menachery et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup> used circulating bat coronaviruses to construct chimeric viruses that used spike W1V1. They found that viruses using the WIV1-CoV spike protein replicated in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures without further spike adaptation
