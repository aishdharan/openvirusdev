<p id="Par31">During a serological surveillance on 218 serum samples from residents in four villages in Jinning County (Yunnan province, China), Wang et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> found six individuals positive to CoV antibodies. A virus neutralization test targeting WIV1 and WIV16 was performed for the six positive samples
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>, and none were able to neutralize either virus, suggesting that the infection in the six subjects had been caused by a SARS-like-CoV virus variant less virulent than SARS-CoV
 <sup>

 </sup>. The failure of the positive sera to either neutralize the virus, or to react with RBD proteins in Western blots could have been caused by the weakness of the response to the bat SARS-like-CoV S protein, or to the circulation of other bat SARS-like-CoV variants in these villages that have highly divergent S proteins

 </sup>. The individuals found positive to the test lived between 1 and 6 km from two caves inhabited by bats of the genus 
 <italic>Rhinolophus spp</italic>., a major reservoir of SARS-like-CoVs
 <sup>

 </sup>. This region had not been involved in the 2002–2003 SARS outbreaks, and these individuals had not been previously in contact with areas, or patients, affected by SARS, suggesting that the positive serological tests were not due to prior infection with SARS-CoV
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. The six seropositive subjects did not recall any clinical symptoms in the twelve months prior to the test, suggesting that the bat SARS-like-CoV infection had either occurred before the time of sampling, or that infections had been sub-clinical, and had caused only mild symptoms
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. However, considering that these individuals had a high chance of direct exposure to bat secretion in their villages, it appears very likely that some bat SARS-like-CoVs had been able to directly infect humans without intermediate hosts, as suggested by the receptor entry and animal infection studies
