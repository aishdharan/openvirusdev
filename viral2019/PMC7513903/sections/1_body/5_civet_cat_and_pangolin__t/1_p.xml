<p id="Par38">During the SARS epidemic in 2002–2003, a new CoV was isolated from two clinically normal wild animal species from a wet-market in Shenzen (China): Himalayan palm civets (
 <italic>Paguma larvata</italic>), and a raccoon dog (
 <italic>Neyctereutes procyonoides</italic>). The virus was classified as member of the new SARS-CoV group

 </sup>. The highest IgG antibody titers to SARS-CoV were observed in traders of masked palm civets (72.7%) compared to traders of all live animals (13%), and healthy controls (1.2%), concluding that the virus was transmitted by the animals from the wet-market
