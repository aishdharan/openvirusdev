<p id="Par44">In the previous chapters, the discussion on the epidemics generated by SARS-CoV and COVID-19 has emphasized their important similarities. However, the two epidemics also have evident differences, the most obvious been the fact that SARS-CoV had somehow failed to reach the pandemic stage. It has now become clear that molecular aspects are likely to have had a role in it. The critical factor appears to be the difference in the S1–S2 cleavage in COVID-19 and SARS CoV, which could influence the efficacy of their interplay with the ACE2 receptor, and thus the infectivity of the two viruses

 </sup>. The S1–S2 cleavage site of COVID-19 has several arginine residues, which indicate high cleavability, while that of SARS-CoV has only one. As a result, the S protein of COVID-19 is efficiently cleaved, but at this site that of SARS-CoV is not. However, the cleavage at the accessory S2’ site within the S2 subunit is instead the same in the two viruses
