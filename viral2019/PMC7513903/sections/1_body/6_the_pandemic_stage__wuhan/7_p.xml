<p id="Par50">At this point, a small digression affords a comment of general nature on the matter of the spreading of coronavirus infections. It appears that the D614G mutation of the Spike protein (personal communication of Enrico Bucci: bucci@shro.org) is also present in SARS-CoV. In principle, based on what has happened with COVID-19, the mutation could have made the SARS-CoV infection capable of proceeding to a pandemic. But fortunately, in SARS-CoV the mutation was accompanied by the mutations in the S1-S2 cleavage site described above that limited its infectivity. One could consider it an abortive attempt of evolution to generate a coronavirus variant far deadlier than COVID-19.</p>
