 <p id="Par52">Of special interest for the present discussion on the pre-pandemic phase are the case of athletes that had participated in the World Military Games that took place in Wuhan from October 18 through October 27, 2019. The event had brought to Wuhan more than 10,000 athletes, plus a very large number of staff personnel: they had come from 110 Countries and of course from all of China as well. A number of them had developed symptoms typical of COVID-19 infection after they had returned home to several countries, e.g., Sweden, France, Italy, and the USA. Actually, five USA athletes had to be repatriated ahead of the end of the games with the diagnosis, but doubts are legitimate, since malaria is not a contagious disease.</p>
