<p id="Par55">In closing, it seems appropriate to mention one last study, interesting but intriguing at the same time, that has appeared very recently
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>. Two genomic regions have been identified in humans which are associated with COVID-19 pathology: one on chromosome 3 that contains six genes, and one on chromosome 9 that determines the ABO blood group
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
 </sup>. Only the first has been significantly associated with severe COVID-19 at the genome-wide level. The genetic variants associated with severe COVID-19 pathology on chromosome 3 span 49,000 bases. The study has analyzed various possibilities, and has concluded that the DNA haplotype could have entered the human population by hybridization- linked gene flow from Neanderthals. It occurs at a frequency of 30% in South Asia, of 8% in Europe, at 4% in Americans, and at lower frequencies in East Asia. It is not known how the Neanderthal-derived haplotype would confer COVID-19 risk and/or, for that matter, risk to other pathogens. Nevertheless, the study concludes that, in the present pandemic the “
 <italic>gene flow from Neanderthals has tragic consequences</italic>”.
