  <title>A representation of the structure and domain organization of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus, which is formed by the two subunits S1 and S2.</title>
  <p>At the N-terminus of subunit S1 a signal peptide permits the insertion of the nascent protein into the secretory pathway of the host cell. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that attaches the S protein to the ACE2 receptor of the host cell. The S2 subunit contains the membrane fusion complex (fusion peptide, heptad repeats HR 1 and HR2), anchors the S2 subunits to the viral membrane with its transmembrane domain, and interacts with the viral ribonucleoprotein complex through its endodomain.
