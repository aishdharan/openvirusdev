<p>The 2000s and 2010s saw tremendous strides in the global control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) through a combination of mass drug administration (MDA), enhanced vector control, and, lately, the development and introduction of new vaccines. However, modern forces linked to the Anthropocene epic, including conflict, political instability, and climate change, may offset these public health gains. Therefore, progress in controlling NTDs in the coming decade may depend on our ability to overcome or circumvent the Anthropocene—our newest geological epoch caused by human activity—hurdles of the 2020s.</p>
