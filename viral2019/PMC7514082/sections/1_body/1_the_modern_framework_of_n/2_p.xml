<p>As 2020 approaches, we will enter our third decade of integrated mass treatment with some impressive results. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 600 million children were treated for soil-transmitted helminth infections in 2017 (the most recent year of WHO reporting), representing almost 70% of children requiring treatment, while 100 million children and adults were treated for schistosomiasisâ€”almost one-half of those requiring treatment [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007872.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Approximately 70% of the 200 million people requiring MDA for onchocerciasis now receive mass treatment, while 1.8 million people living in multiple countries no longer require treatment due to successful elimination efforts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007872.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, through scale-up and integration of MDA, we can envision the eventual elimination of trachoma, LF, and onchocerciasis. Still another observation relevant to MDA is that scale-up and mass treatment have also yielded important collateral public health benefits, including reductions in the global prevalence of yaws, scabies, and other soil-transmitted helminthiases (such as oesophagostomiasis) and even overall reductions in child mortality [
