<p>Outside of MDA, through different approaches, we are making progress towards eliminating other NTDs. Dracunculiasis is near elimination, with multiple human cases reported only from Chad and South Sudan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007872.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Through surveillance, case detection, and treatment, together with vector control, there are now fewer than 10,000 reported cases of human African trypanosomiasis, with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) accounting for more than 80% of the cases [
