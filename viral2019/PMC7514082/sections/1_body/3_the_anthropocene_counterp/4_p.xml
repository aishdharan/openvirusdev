<p>A good example of the struggle between NTD control tools and the Anthropocene is playing out now in DR Congo. In 2019, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) because of an expanding Ebola virus infection epidemic in eastern DR Congo [

In reality, Ebola was not the only catastrophic infection affecting this region, with some estimates indicating that more individuals were actually dying of measles than Ebola virus infection, while cholera had also emerged. An interesting point about all three infectious or neglected diseases is that highly effective vaccines were developed for each of these infections, together with the fact that the global health community put in place important efforts to ensure vaccine access. For example, the new recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus–Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV–ZEBOV) Ebola vaccine shows 90% or more protection against Ebola virus infection when used in programs of ring vaccination of patient contacts [
