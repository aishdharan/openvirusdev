<p id="p0020">Motivated by these works, we propose a theory which lives on an (n + m)-dimensional manifold with two regional manifolds and one bridge manifold. We will show that our region is a part of bigger manifold which is connected with other regional manifold by an extra bridge manifold. Two regional manifolds interact with each other via exchanging fields which move along the bridge manifold. These fields are the main cause for the appearance of transmission risk factors in the model.</p>
