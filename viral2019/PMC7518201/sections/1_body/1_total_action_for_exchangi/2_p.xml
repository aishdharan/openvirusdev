<p id="p0030">Until now, the dependency of transmission risk factors on time has been considered extensively. However, their dependencies on the location have been ignored. In this research, we suggest a model which lets us consider the process of viral transmission between different regions at the same time. In this model, we will make use of some concepts in string theory, and show that all equations in transmission risk theory could be obtained from the string action. In fact, populations seems to be similar to some strings which move between different regions. The behaviour of the infectious, non-infectious and exposed components are similar to gauge, infectious and scalar fields in string theory. This consideration helps us to predict a new pandemic for COVID19.</p>
