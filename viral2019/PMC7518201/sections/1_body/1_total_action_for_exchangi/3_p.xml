 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref>, we present the basis of our theory. In this theory, there are two manifolds, each of which includes 8 regions or countries. Also, there is a bridge manifold which includes three regions or countries. The first manifold presents countries which are the origin of COVID19. The bridge manifold depicts countries through which humans travel to a second manifold. The second manifold comprises countries which are targeted by COVID19. Travelling between countries are represented by strings (
