<p id="p0075">In this research, we have considered the dynamics of exchanged novel coronaviruses (2019-nCov) between countries. We have shown that this action is produced due to the interaction between regional manifolds in (n + m)-dimensional space-time. We have calculated the risk factors of COVID19 and examined our model against experiments. We have shown that multiplying the risk transmission parameters gives a stable action. This means that by increasing these factors in one region, the ones in another region decrease.</p>
