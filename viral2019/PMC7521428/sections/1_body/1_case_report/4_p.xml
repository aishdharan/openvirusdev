<p id="par0040">Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l (normal range 4.0–10.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l), with an elevated neutrophil count of 13.04 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l (normal range 2.06–6.49 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l) and a low lymphocyte count of 0.85 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l (normal range 1.19–3.35 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (90.7 mg/l; cut off &lt;6.0 mg/l), borderline elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (14 mm/1 h), and a slightly elevated interleukin (IL)-6 of 8.7 pg/ml (&lt;6.0 pg/ml). Other blood tests, including levels of high-sensitivity troponin I and other markers of myocardial injury, as well as N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), were within the normal ranges during the patient’s entire hospitalization. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab showed positive results and was followed by serology testing, which also returned positive for both IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Laboratory investigations for common cardiotropic viral agents (coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and parvovirus) were negative.
