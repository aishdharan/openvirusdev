<p id="par0045">Echocardiography showed a hyperechogenic pericardium posterolaterally with minimal localized pericardial effusion. The cardiac chambers were of normal size with normal left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction of 65%) and without regional wall abnormalities or more than mild valve disease. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a small zone of ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe, covering less than 5% of the volume of the lobe (according to the severity score index, 1 point out of a maximum of 5 for a given lobe and 25 for the lung as a whole), without any other pulmonary or upper abdomen pathology.
