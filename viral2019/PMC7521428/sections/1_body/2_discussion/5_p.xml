<p id="par0080">In conclusion, pericarditis should be considered in patients with chest pain, ST elevation on ECG, a normal coronary angiogram, and COVID-19. Accordingly, this atypical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection should not be forgotten. We emphasize the importance of clinical examination and ECG for decision-making in the setting of the COVID-19 epidemic. Future studies are needed to reveal in more detail the pathophysiological relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cardiovascular system, as well as the long-term outcomes of patients who have suffered perimyocardial damage due to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
