<p id="Par2">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exhibits a broad range of genetic heterogeneity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. The HIV epidemic is mainly caused by HIV-1 group M, which accounts for at least 90% of HIV infections worldwide
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. HIV-1 group M is further divided into distinct genotypes, namely A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, and K, as well as hybrids resulting from recombination between genotypes, known as circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) or unique recombinant forms (URFs)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. This genetic diversity is a major obstacle to the development of a vaccine against HIV, as an effective vaccine must protect against diverse HIV genotypes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, HIV genetic diversity may also affect virus pathogenicity, disease progression, and response to antiretroviral treatment (ART) among infected patients
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. A relatively consistent finding is that compared with genotype A, genotype D is associated with mortality before ART
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. Research on HIV-1 subtypes and ART showed that infection with genotype A results in increased mortality compared to that with genotype B in Europe and Canada
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. In China, studies showed that CRF01_AE is associated with faster disease progression from estimated seroconversion to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) compared with non-CRF01_AE in ART-naïve patients
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. These aforementioned studies revealed that HIV-1 genotype differences contribute to variations in disease progression and ART efficiency. However, studies focused on CRF01_AE featured small participant numbers and short follow-up periods, which necessitates broader comparisons between one genotype and all other genotypes grouped together. Furthermore, only a few studies have focused on the CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC genotypes, which are prevalent in China
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, the effects of CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and CRF08_BC have not been directly assessed using mortality as a study end point for either ART-naïve participants or those on ART. This question is urgent with respect to HIV-1 epidemic in China, as transmission accounts for more than 90% of cases, resulting in infections by CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and multilineages of CRF01_AE; this is distinct from the single lineage epidemic of B genotype prevalent in European countries

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. These genotypes are also increasing rapidly among the global proportion of genotypes over time
