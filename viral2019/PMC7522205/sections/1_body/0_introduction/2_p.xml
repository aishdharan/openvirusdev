<p id="Par3">At the end of 2017, more than 70,000 infected patients were living with HIV/AIDS in Guangxi, one of the most important epicenters of the HIV epidemic in China

 </sup>. Assessing genotypes as risk factors for disease progression and the response to ART is both urgent and necessary for better understanding the virus characteristics, justifying the early initiation and efficiency of ART, and reducing mortality and transmission rates. This study was performed to investigate the effects of HIV-1 genotype on baseline CD4+ cell counts and mortality, before and after ART, among newly diagnosed HIV patients. We found that CRF01_AE was significantly associated with a lower baseline CD4+ count and higher mortality before ART treatment, and that combination ART treatment is equally efficient among HIV patients regardless of their HIV-1 genotype.
