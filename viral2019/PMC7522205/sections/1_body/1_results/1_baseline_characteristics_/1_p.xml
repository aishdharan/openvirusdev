<p id="Par4">Of the 6,078 HIV patients who were newly diagnosed between January 1, 2014 and April 30, 2019, 3237 had blood samples available in storage for HIV-1 genotype analysis after western blotting (WB) confirmation tests. Some patients (n = 392) were excluded due to nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) amplification failure (n = 195), length of the nucleotide sequence being less than 1000 base pairs (n = 11), mixed bases of nucleotide sequence being more than 5% (n = 9), failure to link records (n = 16), no CD4+ T lymphocyte (CD4+) cell count measurements (n = 148), or being under the age of 18 years (n = 13). Among 2845 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 2845 HIV patients entered the ART-naïve cohort (before ART) and 2083 HIV patients were included in the ART cohort (after ART; Fig.
