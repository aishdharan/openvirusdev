<p id="Par5">The baseline characteristics of the 2845 patients are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Most patients were over 50 years of age (53.1%), male (74.2%), married or cohabiting (60.5%), Han (81.5%), educated up to primary school level or less (55.3%), employed in farming (78.8%), and infected through heterosexual contact (94.2%). The median time from HIV-positive diagnosis to baseline CD4+ cell count measurements was 7 days [interquartile range (IQR), 2–23 days; Table

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The baseline genotyping data of the 2845 study participants revealed that the predominant genotype was CRF01_AE for 1687 patients (59.3%; 1221 with CRF01_AE Cluster 2, 331 with CRF01_AE Cluster 1, and 135 with other clusters), followed by CRF08_BC for 728 patients (25.6%), CRF07_BC for 254 patients (8.9%), and other genotypes for 176 patients (6.2%; 59 with various other CRFs, 68 with URFs, 37 with CRF55_01B, and 12 with B/B’).
