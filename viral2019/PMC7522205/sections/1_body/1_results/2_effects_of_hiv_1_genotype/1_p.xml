 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the unadjusted and adjusted effects of HIV-1 genotype on baseline CD4+ cell counts in newly diagnosed HIV patients. Among 2845 patients, the median (IQR) baseline CD4+ cell count was 111 cells/μl (31–279), 250 cells/μl (156–377), 205 cells/μl (108–327), and 198 cells/μl (89–355) for CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and other genotypes, respectively. After adjusting for the potential effects of other variables in a multivariable median regression model, the coefficient of baseline CD4+ cell count was 113 (95% CI 86–140) in CRF07_BC, 80 (95% CI 65–95) in CRF08_BC, and 72 (95% CI 37–107) in the other genotypes group, which was significantly higher than that in the CRF01_AE group.
