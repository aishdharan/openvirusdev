 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> presents the unadjusted and adjusted effects of HIV-1 genotype on mortality among newly diagnosed HIV patients in the ART-naïve cohort between 2014 and 2019. There were 451 deaths in this group and a total of 1614.2 person-years were recorded during follow-up. The overall mortality was 31.8 deaths (95% CI 29.0–34.9) per 100 person-years among the study patients. The genotype-associated mortality was 42.6 (95% CI 38.1–47.5), 16.5 (95% CI 10.6–24.5), 21.9 (95% CI 17.6–26.9), and 12.6 (95% CI 6.5–22.1) deaths per 100 person-years for patients with CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and other genotypes, respectively. Before ART, the hazard ratios for the association between the genotype and mortality were almost identical in both univariate and multivariate models. In multivariate analyses, compared to that in HIV patients infected with CRF01_AE, patients infected with CRF07_BC (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI 0.36–0.85), CRF08_BC (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.85), and other genotypes (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI 0.29–0.94) had a significantly lower mortality rate before ART, respectively.
