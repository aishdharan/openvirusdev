<p id="Par8">Based on our data showing that HIV patients infected with CRF01_AE had lower baseline CD4+ cell counts (cells/μl) than those with other HIV-1 genotypes, we speculated that this might lead to a higher death rate before ART. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> presents the subgroup analysis of unadjusted and adjusted effects of HIV-1 genotype on mortality among newly diagnosed HIV patients with a baseline CD4+ cell count of &lt; 350 cells/μl in the ART-naïve cohort. A total of 424 deaths occurred in this group and 934.9 person-years were recorded during follow-up. The overall mortality was 45.3 deaths (95% CI 41.1–49.9) per 100 person-years among the study patients. The genotype-associated mortality was 57.5 (95% CI 51.1–64.4), 26.4 (95% CI 16.2–40.3), 32.0 (95% CI 26.6–40.7), and 20.9 (95% CI 10.9–36.2) deaths per 100 person-years for patients with CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and other genotypes, respectively. The hazard ratios for the association between the genotype and mortality were almost identical in both univariate and multivariate models. The resulting multivariate modeling showed that compared to that for HIV patients infected with CRF01_AE, patients infected with CRF07_BC (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI 0.31–0.76), CRF08_BC (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI 0.47–0.77), and other genotypes (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI 0.26–0.82) had a significantly lower mortality rate before ART, respectively (Table
