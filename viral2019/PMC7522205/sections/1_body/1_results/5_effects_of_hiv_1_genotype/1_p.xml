 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> presents the unadjusted and adjusted effects of HIV-1 genotype on mortality among newly diagnosed HIV patients in the ART cohort between 2014 and 2019. In this cohort, 163 deaths occurred and a total of 4301.8 person-years were recorded during follow-up. The overall mortality was 3.8 deaths (95% CI 3.2–4.4) per 100 person-years among the study patients. The genotype-associated mortality was 4.1 (95% CI 3.4–4.9), 2.2 (95% CI 0.9–4.2), 3.9 (95% CI 2.8–5.4), and 2.1 (95% CI 0.7–4.8) deaths per 100 person-years for patients with CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and other genotypes, respectively. The results from both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that no genotypes were significantly associated with death in this group (Table
