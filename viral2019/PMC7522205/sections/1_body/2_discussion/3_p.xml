<p id="Par12">This study showed that CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and CRF08_BC were the dominant HIV genotypes in Guangxi from 2014 to 2019. CRF01_AE comprised the largest proportion of the endemic strains and was composed mainly of CRF01_AE cluster 1 and cluster 2. It is worth noting that prostitutes from Vietnam have been active in the southern border area of Guangxi in recent years. CRF01_AE cluster 2, which accounts for the biggest proportion of the strains comprising the local epidemic in southern Guangxi, shows high genetic homology with the Vietnamese reference strain, according to a previous study
