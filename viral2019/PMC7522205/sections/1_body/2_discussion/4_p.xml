<p id="Par13">Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, censoring of information caused by loss to follow-up and ART initiation might lead to informative bias regarding the mortality rates of the ART-naïve cohort, particularly if the censoring was not random. Nevertheless, we have made an effort to measure (and include in the model) any covariates that are likely to affect the rate of censoring. Furthermore, we did not observe any differences between genotypes regarding rates of loss to follow-up and ART initiation in the ART-naïve cohort. Second, in this study, the CRF01_AE strains cluster 1 and cluster 2 comprised the bulk of the CRF01_AE infections in Guangxi, which does not cover all clusters of CRF01_AE found in China. It should be noted that we did not find any difference in mortality between CRF01_AE clusters 1 and 2 (data not shown).</p>
