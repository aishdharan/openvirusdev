<p id="Par14">However, these limitations do not invalidate our conclusions. This is the first large cohort study in a real-world setting to evaluate the effects of CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and other genotypes on baseline CD4+ cell counts and mortality before and after ART among newly diagnosed HIV patients. This study revealed that there is a high risk of AIDS mortality for HIV patients due to the rapid progression of CRF01_AE in ART-na√Øve patients, and showed that combination ART is equally efficient among HIV patients regardless of HIV-1 genotype. Our findings highlight the significance of early detection and timely treatment to reduce the risk of AIDS-related mortality.</p>
