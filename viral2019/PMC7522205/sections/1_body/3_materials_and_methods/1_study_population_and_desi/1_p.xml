 </sup>. Local health workers completed standardized reporting forms recording baseline information when HIV patients were newly diagnosed, and follow-up visits were conducted every 3 months before ART. For patients starting ART, follow-up visits occurred at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. This study focused on patients from Guangxi, rural Southwest China. Data were collected from January 1, 2014 to April 30, 2019. The eligibility criteria were HIV-1 patients newly diagnosed between January 1, 2014 and April 30, 2019, age ≥ 18 years, baseline CD4+ cell count measurements, and willingness to participate based on written informed consent when entering CRIMS. Patients with unqualified HIV-1 sequences or the inability to link records were excluded.
