<p id="Par18">The baseline characteristics and CD4+ cell counts of newly diagnosed patients in Guangxi were extracted from the CRIMS database. Patients were successively stratified by treatment status into ART-naïve and ART cohorts, according to ART initiation time. The ART-naïve cohort included HIV patients during the period spanning the date of diagnosis to the date of starting ART, or for patients who did not start ART, to the end of April 30, 2019. The ART cohort included HIV patients from the date of starting ART to April 30, 2019. To assess mortality before and after ART as a life-long process, patients who received ART after being newly diagnosed could be initially placed in the ART-naïve cohort and then moved to the ART cohort, as these groups were separated by ART initiation time.</p>
