<p id="Par21">HIV-1 RNA was extracted from 200 µl of stored blood samples, remaining after western blot (WB) confirmation tests, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This HIV-1 RNA 
 <italic>pol</italic> region encodes regions of the reverse transcriptase and protease genes (HBX2: 2253–3553), which were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with commercial primers according to previously published methods

 </sup>. The PCR products were purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced by Sanger sequencing on an ABI3730xl sequencer (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). Unqualified sequences (length of nucleotide sequence &lt; 1000 base pairs, mixed bases of nucleotide sequence &gt; 5%) were excluded as per laboratory regulations.
