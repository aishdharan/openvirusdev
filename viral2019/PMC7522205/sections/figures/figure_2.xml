  <p>Phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 
   <italic>Pol.</italic> Shimodaira–Hasegawa test was used to alternate the topologies of the whole sequences. Branches, representing their respective sequences, forming node with high confidence (&gt; 90%) was defined as the same type of genotype. The scale length (range: 0–1) represents the difference between sequences (range: 0–100%).
