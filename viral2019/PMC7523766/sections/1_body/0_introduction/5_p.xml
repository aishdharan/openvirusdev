<p>Unlike other forms of KS, AIDS-associated KS has a rapidly progressing disease course, and may disseminate in a short period of time to involve the viscera, including lungs and gastrointestinal tract. 
 <sup>[5]</sup> About 10% to 20% of patients present with advanced disseminated disease and/or complications such as anemia, and are admitted to the inpatient medical wards. Several factors including stage of KS at presentation, ART status, and CD4 counts have been reported to predict outcomes of KS patients.
