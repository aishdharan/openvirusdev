<p>KS remains one of the most common AIDS-related malignancies in Zambia, with numerous admissions to our hospitals. KS patients make up about 70% of all dermatological admissions at UTH. There is paucity of data regarding the factors affecting outcomes of admitted epidemic KS patients. Most previous studies have focused on outcomes of epidemic KS in general, and not specifically on the admitted population of epidemic KS patients. Therefore, this study aimed at determining reasons for admission, and identifying clinical and laboratory parameters that predict mortality or discharge of admitted epidemic KS patients.</p>
