<p>The main objective of the study was to identify reasons for admission and factors associated with outcomes (discharge or mortality) of admitted adult epidemic KS patients at UTH. Ethical approvals for a waiver of consent were obtained from the University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee, and the National Health Research Authority. Obtaining informed consent from the actual participants was not possible, as this was a retrospective study and study participants were not available to give consent, as they were either discharged or had died.</p>
