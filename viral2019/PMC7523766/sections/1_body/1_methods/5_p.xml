<p>All data were analyzed using STATA version 15 (StataCorp, TX). Baseline characteristics were analyzed using summary and descriptive statistics. Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range, while dichotomous or categorical variables are presented as percentages. The Mann–Whitney test was used for group comparisons of continuous variables. Univariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between the dichotomous outcome and the categorical and continuous predictors. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for confounders. Predictors with 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt; .25 on univariate logistic regression and predictors known to be associated with the outcome regardless of 
 <italic>P</italic> values, were included on the multivariate logistic regression model. Among the highly correlated variables, only one was included in the multivariable model. The prediction of our model for outcome was determined by the AUC-ROC curve. The Hosmer–Lameshow goodness of fit test was used to determine how well our model fit the data. We also used the logistic regression model to test for interactions between variables that may possibly modify the observed effect.
