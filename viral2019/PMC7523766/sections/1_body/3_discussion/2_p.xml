<p>This study evaluated the factors associated with mortality of admitted adult epidemic KS patients at UTH, in Zambia. Twenty percent of all our admitted KS patients during the study period died in the hospital. This is similar to a prospective 10-year study conducted in our neighboring country, Tanzania, where a mortality of 24.2% was reported.
