<p>Clinical predictors of mortality on univariate logistic regression included visceral KS, fever, and sepsis. Advanced KS presents as multiple disseminated KS lesions with or without massive lymphedema and often accompanied with visceral involvement. When KS involves the viscera, commonly lungs and gastrointestinal tract, patients often have systemic life-threatening complications requiring admission and intensive care. Hence, the prognosis for advanced KS is usually poor.
