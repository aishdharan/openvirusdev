<p>After controlling for other predictors of mortality, only sepsis (or signs and symptoms of sepsis) was independently associated with mortality. Sepsis is common in immunosuppressed HIV patients. It has been previously identified as a major cause of admission and mortality in HIV patients.

 </sup> Unfortunately, blood cultures were not done to confirm the diagnosis of sepsis in our patients due to unavailability of resources. It is possible that the signs and symptoms of sepsis were due to a phenomenon called Kaposi sarcoma inflammatory cytokine response (KICS). KICS is common in severely ill KS patients, mimics severe sepsis, is associated with high Interleukin 6 (IL-6) production, associated with high KSHV viral loads, and is also associated with a high mortality rate.

 </sup> It is more probable that our patients had KICS and not sepsis. This is because empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics that are known to be effective in septic HIV individuals in our setting were administered in our patients with signs of sepsis; however, these antibiotics had no effect and even seemed to be associated with poor outcomes. Furthermore, there was no interaction between treatment with intravenous antibiotics and a diagnosis of sepsis. Prospective cohort studies and more extensive laboratory testing need to be conducted to address this issue.
