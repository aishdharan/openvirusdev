<p>We could not definitely differentiate sepsis vs KICS because blood cultures, KSHV viral loads, and IL-6 levels were not assessed during admission. A prospective cohort study would be required to definitively address this. In addition, the sample size was not powered enough to determine statistical differences in marginally significant variables including hemoglobin levels and creatinine on multivariate regression.</p>
