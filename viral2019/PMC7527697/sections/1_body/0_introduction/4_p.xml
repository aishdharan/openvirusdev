<p id="para100">We did a randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based ART initiation, monitoring, and resupply, and ART initiation at the clinic followed by monitoring and resupply in the community (hybrid approach), compared with standard clinic ART initiation, monitoring, and resupply for people with detectable HIV viral load in South Africa and Uganda. The primary objectives were to evaluate the relative effectiveness of community-based ART versus clinic-based ART on the proportion of people living with HIV who had viral suppression and the cost per person virally suppressed through community-based ART delivery.</p>
