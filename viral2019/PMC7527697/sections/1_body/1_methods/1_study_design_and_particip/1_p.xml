<p id="para110">We did a multicentre, unblinded, household-randomised trial of community-based ART (ART initiation, monitoring, and resupply) and a hybrid approach (ART initiation at the clinic with community monitoring and resupply), compared with standard clinic ART delivery among people from South Africa and Uganda with detectable HIV viral load (&gt;20 copies per mL; the lower limit of detection). We hypothesised that community-based ART would overcome logistical barriers to care, simplify monitoring and ART resupply, and increase viral suppression rates. Further, the increased cost of community-based ART delivery would be offset by the higher proportion of clients reaching viral suppression. Also, we hypothesised that starting ART at the clinic and then transferring monitoring and resupply to the community would cost less but the proportion virally suppressed would be lower than with community-based ART initiation. Finally, we hypothesised that community-based ART would increase viral suppression among men, who are less likely to link to HIV care at the clinic.</p>
