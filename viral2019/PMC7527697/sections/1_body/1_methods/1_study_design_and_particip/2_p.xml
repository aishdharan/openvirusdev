<p id="para120">The DO ART study was done in rural and peri-urban areas of high and medium HIV prevalence in South Africa and Uganda: 11 communities in uMgungundlovu District, KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa; five communities in the uMkhanyakude District, northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa; and six in the Sheema District in southwest Uganda. Population HIV prevalence in KwaZulu-Natal was 36%,

All settings had public clinics that offered access to ART at no cost, and, since 2016, universal access to ART at all CD4 cell count measurements. These communities are characterised by high unemployment, low per-capita income (less than US$2 per day), and income inequality.
