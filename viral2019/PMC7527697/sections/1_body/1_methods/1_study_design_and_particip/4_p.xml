<p id="para140">Trained nurses and supervised lay counsellors conducted study activities including ART initiation, refills, and monitoring. Staff received standardised national training in nurse-led HIV testing and counselling; clinical evaluation for ART initiation; ART initiation, monitoring, and adverse effects; and national algorithms for HIV care. Participants completed a questionnaire that included demographics and HIV risk with the mobile phone software Mobenzi Gateway (Cape Town, South Africa). Lay counsellors did HIV testing with standardised pre-test and post-test counselling and couples counselling, including mutual disclosure counselling. People living with HIV received additional point of care testing to stage their HIV and assess clinical eligibility for community-based ART initiation: CD4 cell count, WHO clinical HIV stage, pregnancy testing, creatinine testing to assess renal function, and symptom screening for tuberculosis. A dried blood spot was collected to assess HIV viral load at baseline.</p>
