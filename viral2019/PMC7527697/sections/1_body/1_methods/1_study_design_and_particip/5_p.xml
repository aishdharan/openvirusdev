<p id="para150">People living with HIV were eligible for random assignment if they were able to provide informed consent, aged 18 years or older, resident in the participating communities, clinically stable (CD4 cell count &gt;100 cells per μL, WHO HIV stage 1–3, not pregnant, normal renal function, and had no symptoms on a standardised symptom screen for active tuberculosis), and not taking ART at the time of assessment or in the past 3 months. 1 year after study activation, we added the inclusion criteria of detectable viral load because of a higher than expected proportion of participants with suppressed viral load at baseline, probably reflecting pre-existing diagnosis of HIV and undisclosed ART use as has been reported in other settings.
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Participants with a suppressed viral load were retained in the study and completed all study procedures according to their study group. Participants who were not eligible for random assignment for clinical reasons or pregnancy were referred to care and followed-up until they were linked to clinic-based services. We chose a CD4 threshold of more than 100 cells per μL to facilitate clinic care for people with advanced HIV or AIDS who are at risk for opportunistic infections.
