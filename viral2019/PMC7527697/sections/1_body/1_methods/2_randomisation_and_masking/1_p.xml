<p id="para170">The study biostatistician generated the randomisation allocation stratified by site and country. The randomisation allocation was automatically assigned by mobile phone software to the study participant. Once eligibility was assessed, the randomisation assignment was revealed to the participant and staff. The study staff did not have access to the randomisation code. Eligible participants in the same household were randomly assigned to the same group to prevent crossover between study groups.
