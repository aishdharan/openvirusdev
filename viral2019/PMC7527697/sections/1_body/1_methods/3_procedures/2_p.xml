Until notification of ART initiation, they received quarterly telephone calls to enquire as to whether they had initiated ART and to record adverse events. Once participants had initiated ART at the clinic, they had community-based monitoring and refills, following identical procedures for the community-based ART delivery group and thus described as a hybrid between the clinic and community-based strategies.</p>
