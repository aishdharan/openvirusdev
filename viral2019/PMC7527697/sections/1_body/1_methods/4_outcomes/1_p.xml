<p id="para230">The primary trial endpoint was the proportion of participants who had HIV viral suppression (&lt;20 copies per mL) assessed at month 12; plasma viral load testing was done by an accredited laboratory at each site. The cost per person who was virally suppressed in the community-based group was a coprimary endpoint assessed through activity-based microcosting. Safety was a secondary outcome and was assessed through adverse event reporting and clinical chart abstraction. Viral suppression in South Africa and among men were prespecified secondary outcomes.</p>
