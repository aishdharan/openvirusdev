<p id="para240">Rapid HIV testing was done according to national guidelines: in Uganda, Determine HIV 1–2 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) followed by Statpak (Chembio Diagnostics, Medford, NY, USA) for confirmation of positive results, and Unigold (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland) was used if results were not confirmatory. In South Africa, Determine HIV 1–2 (Abbott Laboratories) and First Response HIV 1–2-0 Card Test (Prima Medical, Kachigam, India) with SD BIOLINE HIV-1/2 Rapid (G-Ocean, Hong Kong) were used if results were not confirmatory. Creatinine testing was done with point-of-care StatSensor Xpress (Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA, USA) in South Africa or via a laboratory based COBAS INTEGRA 400 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) platform in Uganda. Point-of-care CD4 cell count testing (Pima, Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) was done using a finger-stick specimen. Plasma HIV viral load was assessed by PCR (COBAS AmpliPrep or TaqMan, Roche, Mannheim, Germany, with a limit of detection of 20 copies per mL) in Uganda and bDNA (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France, with a limit of detection of 20 copies per mL) in South Africa. Baseline viral load was tested from dried blood spots via bDNA (bioMérieux, with a limit of detection of 20 copies per mL).</p>
