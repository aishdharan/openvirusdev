<p id="para250">We did activity-based microcosting to assess the cost of community-based ART, including time and motion studies to estimate the number of clients that could be seen in 1 day. We estimated the annual per-client cost of community-based ART care from the provider's perspective. We report separate cost estimates for the first year of ART (including start-up costs, ART initiation, and five follow-up visits) and additional years of ART (consisting of four follow-up visits once every 3 months). Costs included all activities and supplies supporting ART initiation and follow-up including personnel, laboratory testing, and medications (

 </xref> The costs are presented in 2018 US dollars (US$), as 2018 was the midpoint of the study. To reflect implementation under a scaled-up scenario, we estimated costs with South African and Ugandan Ministry of Health salaries and projected client volume using the time and motion data. We compared scaled-up costs of community ART delivery with estimates from previous studies of the annual per-person estimates of the cost of clinic ART in South Africa
