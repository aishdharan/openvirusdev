<p id="para260">A target sample size of 1200 individuals living with HIV not on ART was calculated to provide at least 90% power to see a 10% absolute difference in viral suppression (estimated 65% viral suppression in the clinic group, 75% in the hybrid group, and 85% in the community-based ART delivery group), assuming 5% loss to follow-up and a significance level of 0Â·05. Because of the unexpectedly high number of participants with suppressed viral loads at baseline (who we planned to exclude from the modified intention-to-treat primary analysis) and to sufficiently power the study for a subgroup analysis among men, the protocol was modified to allow enrolment of up to 1800 participants, with a target of at least 600 men with detectable baseline viral load. We calculated that with 600 men, we would have more than 90% power to see a 15% change in viral load suppression (45% in the clinic group, 60% in the hybrid group, and 75% in the community group). All available month 12 assessments from participants contributed to assignment of whether the participant was virally suppressed.</p>
