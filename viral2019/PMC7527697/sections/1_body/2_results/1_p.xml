<p id="para310">Between May 26, 2016, and March 28, 2019, 9094 participants were identified for HIV testing and counselling and 8265 (90·9%) were tested (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref>). Of those tested, 3957 (47·8%) were men. Overall, 2479 (30·0%) participants tested positive for HIV and 2393 (96·5%) of the participants who tested positive completed screening for the DO ART Study. Of the 862 individuals who were ineligible for randomisation, 588 (68%) were virally suppressed at baseline, 66 (8%) reported currently being on ART, 76 (9%) screened positive with the symptomatic TB screening questionnaire, 36 (4%) had a CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells per μL, and 26 (3%) were pregnant. 1531 participants were randomly assigned: 514 (34%) to the clinic group, 509 (33%) to the hybrid group, and 508 (33%) to the community-based group. 71 participants were lost to follow-up: 23 (32%) in the clinic group, 32 (45%) in the hybrid group, and 16 (23%) in the community-based group; of the 71, nine (13%) died, 12 (17%) withdrew, 36 (50%) moved, and 14 (20%) were lost to follow-up for an unknown reason. At least 417 (82%) participants completed each visit (months 1, 3, 6, and 9) in the community-based ART delivery group (

We planned a priori to exclude participants with suppressed baseline viral load (n=216) for the modified intention-to-treat primary analysis, which meant 1315 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis: 446 in the clinic group, 442 in the hybrid group, and 427 in the community group. Of the 1315 participants in the analysis, the primary outcome of HIV viral load was available for 1253 (95·3%).
