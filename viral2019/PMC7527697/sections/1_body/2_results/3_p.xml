 <sub>superiority</sub>&lt;0·0001) and the hybrid approach (66%, RR 1·19, 1·02–1·40; p
 <sub>superiority</sub>=0·026), compared with standard of care (54%). Notably, there was a significant interaction between gender and study group for both the community-based ART (p=0·0067) and the hybrid group (p=0·035) compared with clinic ART. Viral suppression was similar for men (156 [73%] of 213) and women (150 [75%] of 201) in the community-based ART group, compared with 120 (54%) of 221 for men and 149 (73%) of 205 for women in the clinic group. Overall, the absolute increase in viral suppression was 18·4% (95% CI 9·5–27·2) for men in the community-based group compared with the clinic-based group (
