<p id="para340">In a pre-planned subgroup analysis for South Africa, compared with clinic ART, community-based ART increased viral suppression (60%

 <sub>non-inferiority</sub>=0·0026, RR &gt;0·95). In South Africa, both community strategies significantly increased viral suppression among men: community-based ART (72%, RR 1·39, 95% CI 1·17–1·66) and the hybrid approach (65%, RR 1·26, 1·04–1·51), compared with standard of care (51%). There was significant interaction for gender and study group for both community-based ART (p=0·015) and the hybrid group (p=0·037) compared with clinic ART in the South African subset. The absolute increase in viral suppression was 20·4% (95% CI 10·0–30·3) for South African men in the community-based group compared with the clinic-based group (
