<p id="para350">We did multiple sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of our assumptions on the study outcomes (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>). Specifically, we included participants who were virally suppressed at baseline; the intention-to-treat analysis. This method did not change the primary outcome that, compared with clinic-based ART, community-based ART was superior (65% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 75%, RR 1·15, 95% CI 1·06–1·25) and the hybrid approach remained non-inferior (65% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 69%, RR 1·06, 0·98–1·16; p
 <sub>non-inferiority</sub>=0·0054, RR&gt;0·95). In further pre-planned sensitivity analyses, including using the WHO viral suppression threshold of less than 1000 copies per mL, community-based ART remained superior overall, and the hybrid group was non-inferior versus clinic ART. In a post-hoc analysis, participants enrolled after the median site enrolment date were not more likely to have viral suppression (p=0·81).
