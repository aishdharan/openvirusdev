<p id="para360">Assuming that 7–13 clients are seen per work day, and including the cost of ART, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, laboratory testing, personnel, supplies, fuel, and overheads, we estimated that the annual cost of community-based ART per client was $217 in Uganda and $308–312 in South Africa in the first year and $187 in Uganda and $244–246 in South Africa in subsequent years (
