<p id="para380">This randomised trial in high and medium HIV prevalence settings in South Africa and Uganda provides evidence that community-based delivery of ART, including HIV testing, same-day ART initiation, mobile van monitoring, and ART resupply increases viral suppression among people living with HIV with detectable viral load, particularly among men, compared with standard clinic-based services. The hybrid approach of ART initiation at the clinic, followed by monitoring and refills in the community, was non-inferior than clinic ART suggesting that streamlined services could be beneficial from the first step of testing and throughout the continuum of HIV care for people not already in care. Streamlined services that overcome barriers to care can increase the proportion of people living with HIV who start ART and reach viral suppression.</p>
