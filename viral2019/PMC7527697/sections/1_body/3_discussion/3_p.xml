<p id="para400">In pre-planned subgroup analyses, we found that the difference between the community-based group and the clinic-based group was higher for men, and this difference was present in the overall sample and when restricted to data from South Africa, where both the community and hybrid approaches significantly increased viral suppression for men. Notably, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal of 73% viral suppression among people living with HIV (in this case, with detectable viral load) was met for both men and women in the community-based ART group, eliminating disparities by gender. Universal test and treat HIV prevention studies have shown either no difference or a smaller than expected decrease in HIV incidence at the population level,
