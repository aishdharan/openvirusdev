<p id="para410">At scale, we project that the cost of community-based ART could be similar to previously published estimates of the cost of clinic ART.

Refining components of the community-based ART delivery strategy could decrease or contain costs, which might be necessary in areas where the density of clients is low. For example, providing 6-month resupply of ART instead of 3-month resupply could save personnel costs with no difference in viral suppression or retention in care.
