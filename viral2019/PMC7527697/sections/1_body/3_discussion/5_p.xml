<p id="para420">Although community-based approaches to ART delivery have growing policy support, implementation is at an early stage. Concerns raised about community-based ART include the safety of clients who would not have regular contact with the clinic and that streamlined care could lead to less engagement in care. We found similar rates of serious and severe adverse events across the three study groups, indicating that community-based ART is likely to be as safe as clinic-based ART. Further, the proportion of people reaching viral suppression was higher through community-based ART, which could increase health gains over time. Lastly, for scale-up, implementation will need a mix of behavioural and social interventions to see the same (or larger) effect sizes across heterogeneous settings.</p>
