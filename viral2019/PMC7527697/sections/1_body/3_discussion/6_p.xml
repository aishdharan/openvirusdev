<p id="para430">The study has several limitations. More than half of the participants succeeded at the clinic and it is probable that additional changes to the standard of care at the clinic (eg, fast-track ART, which was available later in the study) could have improved viral suppression in the clinic-based group, attenuating the effect. However, the date of enrolment did not change the primary finding for viral suppression. Importantly, missing data for viral load at exit among participants lost to follow-up did not change the primary result (

The comparison with the clinic costs was not generated from the clinics our participants attended. However, a target cost of $200 per client on ART per year (including ART, clinical care, and laboratory monitoring) is used for the investment case for HIV treatment.

 </xref> We present the primary costing results herein; a planned cost-effectiveness analysis will be done to evaluate the health gains associated with the change in costs. Our study was limited to settings with medium and high HIV prevalence and might not be generalisable to settings with lower prevalence, as sufficient volume is required for community-based ART to be cost-efficient. The study was limited to adults because efficacy and safety of community-based ART had not been established in people younger than 18 years. Adolescents are a priority group and should be included in future evaluations of community-based ART.
