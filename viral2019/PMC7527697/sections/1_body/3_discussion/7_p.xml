<p id="para440">The strengths of the study include the randomised design, the use of a clinical mobile app, successful enrolment of men (51% of the study population; previous studies have typically enrolled &lt;30% men), and high retention across all three randomised groups. The study's coprimary aims were effectiveness, measured by proportion of participants who were virally suppressed, and cost per person virally suppressed so that affordability of community-based ART delivery could be considered in addition to effectiveness. With use of a mobile app, standardised care was provided following clinical algorithms thus limiting medical errors and facilitating task shifting.</p>
