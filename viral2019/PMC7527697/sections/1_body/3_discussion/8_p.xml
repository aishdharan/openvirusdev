<p id="para450">The next steps for community-based ART are testing at scale and evaluating the costs and effect in other high HIV prevalence settings with a baseline gender gap in suppression. Although community-based ART resulted in viral suppression among approximately three-quarters of individuals living with HIV, additional services are needed to reach the remaining quarter. Specifically, home delivery of ART and long-acting injectable ART could overcome remaining logistical barriers. Future research directions should focus on scalable, client-centred strategies to deliver ART.</p>
