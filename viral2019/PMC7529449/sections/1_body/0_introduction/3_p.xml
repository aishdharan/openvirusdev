<p>An example of one of the greatest progresses made in combating this epidemic was the discovery of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) for HIV infection, but its effectiveness and efficiency depend on a series of factors associated with patient compliance. For this reason, the assessment of adherence has been verified by different mechanisms, such as real-time assessment and the verification of the concentration of ART in the hair or blood

 <sup>)</sup>. The adoption of measures to assess adherence is essential, as inadequate adherence to ART causes an increase in circulating viral load and, consequently, directly interferes in the control of infection and disease progression

In addition, there is an impact on the patientâ€™s life expectancy and influence on medical costs related to the progression of the disease, complications, hospitalizations and the treatment of new infections, with adherence being the primary factor for the control of this infection and the early detection of HIV
