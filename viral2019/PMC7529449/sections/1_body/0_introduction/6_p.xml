<p>In recent years, some systematic reviews have shown that interventions based on medical consultations, nursing consultations, telephone calls, text messaging, financial incentives and behavioral therapy have improved adherence to ART, but none has carried out an assessment from an economic and epidemiological perspective, aiming to demonstrate how these interventions interfere in the long term in the incidence of new cases

In this sense, non-medication and cost-effective interventions, from an economic point of view, such as sending text messages, can help maintain adherence throughout ART without dispensing high costs to the health system and with easy applicability for large populations regardless of their location and facility to the health system
