<p>Conducting the RCT was necessary due to the lack of information in the literature regarding the best frequency of sending text messages to reduce viral load in the context of the public health system in Brazil. The prospective and double-blind RCT was performed at the University Hospital of Santa Maria, linked to the Federal University of Santa Maria, from July 2016 to October 2018, in order to assess the impact on the viral load of sending SMS. The referred Hospital assists approximately 1,200 people infected with HIV, of whom 500 are being followed up at the infectious disease outpatient clinic and the others attend the service for laboratory tests and medication withdrawal. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Santa Maria and published in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials, under the RBR-9nt9hv identifier.</p>
