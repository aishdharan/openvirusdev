<p>Regarding the circulating viral load values according to the groups, it was verified that, in the control group, there was an increase in the studied period (pre viral load = 2,638.85; post viral load = 11,890.31; p = 0.001), in intervention group A (weekly SMS sending) there was a reduction in the studied period (pre viral load = 4,598.92; post viral load = 5.68; p = 0.002) and, in group B (biweekly SMS sending) there was no statistically significant difference in the studied period (pre viral load = 854.11, post viral load = 3.367,83; p = 0.649). Thus, sending weekly SMSs was 1.26 times more likely to have a viral load below 50 copies/ml when compared to the group not submitted to intervention.</p>
