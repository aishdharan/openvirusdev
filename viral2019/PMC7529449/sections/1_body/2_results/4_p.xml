<p>The dynamic cohort model estimated that, with the standard treatment in the 2019 cohort, 29,386,767 people would die and 2,011,964 would be infected with HIV in the 20-year period. These cases would result in R$ 141 billion in total treatment costs. The alternative strategy (SMS) would avoid 286,538 new HIV infections and 282 deaths in the 20-year period when compared to the standard treatment. The alternative strategy would result in saving R$ 14 billion in treatment costs (
