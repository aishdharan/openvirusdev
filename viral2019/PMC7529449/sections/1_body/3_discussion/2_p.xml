<p>The SMS intervention generates savings of nearly R$ 14 billion in terms of treatment costs for the SUS in Brazil and helps in the reduction of 263,424 new HIV infections, considering the 20-year period. When projecting the effects of the discrepancy at the beginning of treatment between the two groups, for the same period of life, we verified that the SMS-based intervention accumulated more years of life gain (incremental effectiveness) and lower cost (incremental cost) than the control group. Maintaining the standard treatment would result in an additional cost of R$ 50,862.36 per infection when compared to the SMS intervention. The robustness of the lifetime model was verified by the sensitivity analysis, with variations of the transition probabilities and costs. The SMS intervention was the dominant treatment (lowest cost and highest effectiveness) compared to the current treatment (highest cost and lowest effectiveness), which leads to a negative Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio (ICER).</p>
