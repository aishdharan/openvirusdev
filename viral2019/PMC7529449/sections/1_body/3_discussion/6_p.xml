<p>The main strength of this dynamic cohort analysis was that the sources of the intervention parameter (sending SMS, and control group) were based on real-life data, from an RCT. In addition, the model estimated the evolution of the intervention over 20 years, demonstrating the linear increase in cost over this period, and the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the predicted model. It is worth highlighting that this is the first study carried out in the context of the SUS that considers an intervention based on SMS at the population level.</p>
