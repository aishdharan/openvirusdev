<p>This study had some limitations. First, the effectiveness of the SMS intervention was based on the RCT data, but some clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from the Ministry of Health data source; however, the values of these parameters were applied to both groups (SMS 
 <italic>versus</italic> control), thus not affecting the relative effectiveness of the model. Second, the parameters of this study were derived from a 6-month intervention, which may have diluted the effect of the SMS intervention in the population context over time, just as with each year of planned intervention there is an increase in data uncertainty. However, these limitations do not preclude the results presented since, in the first year after the intervention, positive results are already obtained.
