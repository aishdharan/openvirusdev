<p>The results presented in this study demonstrate an advance in knowledge through the use of an RCT associated with a dynamic cohort model with Markov states, of the long-term evolution of interventions in patients with HIV, demonstrating its impact on transmissibility, mortality, and costs. Therefore, this study may subsidize complementary health actions through other technologies of communication with the patient which contribute to the increase of adherence in patients on ART and to a consequent reduction of transmissibility, as well as allowing for its replication in different contexts.</p>
