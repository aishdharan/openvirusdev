<p>Measles infection is a risk-factor for permanent hearing, visual, and cognitive impairments [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At this time, there is little routine surveillance/screening among children in the Pacific Islands who are at-risk of these neurological complications following causal infections such as measles. The current state of recovery presents an opportunity to actively review children who survived the recent measles epidemic for any permanent sensory impairments. These activities may provide a foundation for routine targeted surveillance/screening, not only for measles, but other infectious causes of permanent disability (eg, meningitis).
