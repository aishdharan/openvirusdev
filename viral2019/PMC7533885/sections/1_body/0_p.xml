<p content-type="flushleft">Controlling zoonotic and vector-borne infections is complex, as it requires an accurate understanding of pathogen transmission within animal populations, and pathogen spillover to humans, while accounting for environmental factors affecting vector population dynamics (

 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging zoonotic arbovirosis causing hemorrhagic fever. RVF is a threat for both animal and human health, mainly in Africa (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) are RVF virus (RVFV)-amplifying hosts, acquiring infection through the bites of infectious mosquitoes (mainly

 <italic>Culex</italic> spp.) (

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Since 2015, RVF has been listed as a priority emerging disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) R&amp;D Blueprint (

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Current disease control options for reducing disease risk in humans heavily rely on controlling virus transmission in animal populations. The impact of disease control measures in livestock on reducing RVF risk in humans has not yet been assessed, and doing so requires estimating key transmission parameters between livestock, and from livestock to humans, using animal and human epidemiological data.
