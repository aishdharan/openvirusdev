<p>Mayotte, an island located in the southwestern Indian Ocean region, reported a RVF epidemic in 2007–2008 (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In a previous paper, we used longitudinal livestock seroprevalence data to model RVFV emergence in the livestock population, and we estimated that the likelihood of reemergence was very low in a closed ecosystem (i.e., without introduction of infectious animals). However, a few imported infectious animals could trigger another large epidemic, as the herd immunity declined due to livestock population turnover (

 </xref>). The virus belongs to the Kenya-2 clade (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which is closely related to the strains detected in recent outbreaks in Eastern Africa. The Veterinary Services of Mayotte, the regional health authorities (Agence de Santé Océan Indien) and the French Public Health Agency (Santé Publique France) did further epidemiological investigations to assess temporal patterns of infection in the animal population, and to identify possible routes of human exposure to RVFV. These investigations generated a uniquely well-documented RVF epidemic dataset, including RVF seroprevalence and incidence data in animal and humans.
