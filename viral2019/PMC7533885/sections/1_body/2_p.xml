<p>We present these data and use them to extend and fit a mathematical model of RVFV transmission in livestock (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and explicitly account for viral spillover from livestock into the human population. We fit this model simultaneously to the infection patterns in livestock and humans observed during the 2018â€“2019 epidemic, allowing 1) to estimate the level of RVFV transmission among livestock and spillover from livestock to humans by both direct contact and vector-mediated routes, 2) to estimate the likelihood of another epidemic the following year, and 3) to assess the impact of potential vaccination strategies in livestock and humans on reducing disease occurrence in humans.
