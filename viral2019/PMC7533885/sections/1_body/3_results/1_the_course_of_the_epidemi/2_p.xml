<p>Livestock sera (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,169) collected by the Veterinary Services between July 2018 and June 2019 were tested against RVF IgG. To assess the timing of emergence of the virus in the livestock population, we plotted quarterly age-stratified RVF IgG seroprevalence, using only tested animals for which the date of birth was available (
 <italic>n</italic> = 493). In July to September 2018, that is, before the report of the first human case, most seropositive animals were in the oldest age groups (

 </xref>), probably indicating viral exposure during the previous epizootic (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The IgG seroprevalence increased in all age groups in January to March (

 </xref>), and then in April to June 2019 (

 </xref>), demonstrating that the emergence of the virus in the livestock population occurred simultaneously with the report of cases in humans, following an interepidemic period of 10 y.
