<p>We modeled virus transmission among livestock as a function of rainfall. We divided the human population into two groups. In the first group (named “farming” group), individuals were assumed to be in regular contact with animals, and RVF viral spillover was modeled by both direct contact and vector-mediated routes. In the other group, individuals could acquire infection only by the vector-mediated route (“nonfarming” group). In the base case, the farming and nonfarming groups represented 30% and 70% of the population, respectively (
