<p>Using the estimated parameters, the simulated number of human reported cases was 173 (95% CrI [133–224]), with about two-thirds from the farming group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 106) and one-third from the nonfarming group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 67) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 
  <italic>B</italic> and 
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>). The predicted age-stratified IgG seroprevalence in livestock between January and June 2019 were in good agreement with the observed data as well (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 
  <italic>E</italic> and

 </xref>). The simulated incidence in livestock cases peaked mid-February (February 11–17), concomitantly with the peak in human vector-mediated transmission, while the number of human cases by direct contact reached its maximum values over the last 2 wk of February (February 11–24) (

 </xref>). By the end of the epidemic wave, 17,723 (95% CrI [14,170–20,481]) animals were affected, resulting in 52.0% (95% CrI [42.9–59.4]) of the livestock population being immune (

 </xref> and

 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Assuming that 30% of the population were farmers (directly exposed to livestock), they were 3.6 times more likely than nonfarmers to have experienced infection during the epidemic (
