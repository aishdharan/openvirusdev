<p>Probabilistic forecasts were also used to assess the impact of different livestock and human vaccination strategies on the size of the epidemic in both animals and humans (

A reactive and mass vaccination campaign in livestock immediately after the report of the first human case in which 6,000 doses are delivered in December 2018 allowed a reduction in the epidemic size by a third (median number of reported humans cases, 113 cases; median number of livestock cases, 11,397), while waiting one more month would have required 50% more vaccine doses to achieve a similar impact (9,000 doses in January 2019; median number of humans reported cases, 117; median number of livestock cases, 11,576). Finally, a vaccination program targeting 80% of individuals in the farming group (61,560 doses in December 2018) reduced similarly the number of human cases (median, 111 cases), while, of course, not impacting on the number of livestock cases. Vaccinating half of the human population in both groups would have required 128,250 doses (20 times more than livestock doses), for a smaller impact (
