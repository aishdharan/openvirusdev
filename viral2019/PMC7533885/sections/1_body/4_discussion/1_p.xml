<p content-type="flushleft">We present a RVF epidemic dataset combining both livestock and human surveillance data and use it to parameterize a mathematical model. We estimated transmission rates among livestock and spillover to humans using empirical epidemic data, as well as the fraction of human cases resulting from direct contact and vector transmission. This model also allowed the quantitative assessment of the importance of timely livestock vaccination in reducing disease risk in humans during an epidemic, useful to inform potential control programs, and illustrating the importance of One Health surveillance in the management of zoonotic diseases.</p>
