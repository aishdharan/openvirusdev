<p>The IgM testing of illegally imported livestock suggested that the virus may have been introduced in Mayotte around June to August 2018, which is in agreement with the timing of RVF outbreaks on the East African mainland (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and corresponds to the dry season in Mayotte. Viral transmission might have been maintained on the island at a low level in the dry season, or the virus might have been several times introduced, and the epidemic started only following the start of the rainy season (that is, in October). The epidemic is likely to have therefore resulted from a recent viral reintroduction, rather that viral persistence over the last 10 y, as concluded about the 2007â€“2008 epidemics, in a previous study (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Furthermore, since transovarial transmission of the virus in vectors is believed to play a minor mechanism for RVFV persistence on the island (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), we modeled the epidemic following virus introduction on the island, and not local reemergence from mosquito eggs.
