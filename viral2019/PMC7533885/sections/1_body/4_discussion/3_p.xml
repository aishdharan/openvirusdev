<p>The systematic testing by RT-PCR of humans showing dengue-like syndrome performed in Mayotte over the last 10 y (since 2008) provided additional evidence that RVF had been absent from the island for a decade, and that the presented epidemic curve accurately reflected its actual timing. During the epidemic, mitigation strategies such as vector control around houses of human cases (i.e., postdetection) and the diffusion of prevention messages on milk consumption and exposure to animals were communicated, from February 27 onward (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), that is, 2 wk after the peak. Therefore, these measures are likely to have little impact on the epidemic size, unaffecting the time of the epidemic peak. In addition, the timing of the epidemic was corroborated by the observed changes in livestock seroprevalence, exhibiting a clear pattern of viral emergence. Most livestock sera (90%) were collected and tested as part of the regular annual surveillance campaign. As 10% of these samples were collected in areas reporting human cases, the proportion of seropositive animals may have been overestimated. However, most animal sampling was conducted from January 2019 onward, when RVFV had already spread across the whole island. In addition, our model predicted that 52.0% (95% CrI [42.9–59.4]) of the livestock population was immune at the end of the simulated epidemic wave (August 2019), which was in line with estimates from the previous emergence in 2007–2008 (
