<p>The impact and cost-effectiveness of livestock vaccination have been assessed in specific RVF high-risk areas in Kenya using simulation modeling (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Our analysis demonstrates the impact of vaccination strategies on reducing the number of human and animal cases, through a model calibrated from epidemic data. Our findings provide evidence that reactive animal vaccination is the most effective control measure, preventing both human and livestock cases, and requiring a smaller number of vaccine doses. The characteristics of the vaccine used in the vaccination scenarios (highly immunogenic, single dose, and safe) were those optimal targeted by WHO R&amp;D Blueprint (
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), and not the existing ones. Therefore, we present the “best-case” scenarios. RVF vaccines currently available have different immunogenic and safety characteristics, with some of them requiring boosters (
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Scenarios using vaccines requiring boosters may have shown a delayed impact on the epidemic compared with the scenarios tested, by increasing the time to build up immunity. In practice, the choice of which vaccine to use in the field may vary with epidemiological context, and administering a vaccine with a booster would require at least doubling resources. During this epidemic in Mayotte, livestock were not vaccinated due the absence of a vaccine with a European Union (EU) marketing authorization (Mayotte is an EU outermost region) (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, we highlight the importance of developing contingency plans, including emergency funds, should a suitable vaccine becomes available.
