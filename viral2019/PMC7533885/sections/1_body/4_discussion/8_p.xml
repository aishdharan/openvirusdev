<p>In conclusion, we have presented a uniquely detailed investigation into an outbreak of an emerging arbovirus, combining animal and human data, with a mathematical model for RVF. Our estimates can be used as a benchmark to parameterize RVF epidemic models developed for other areas. The model can be recalibrated to other epidemic settings to estimate ecosystem-specific transmission parameters, or further extended should epidemiological and entomological data be available at suitable space–time resolutions. Disease surveillance in animals, contingency planning, and the timely implementation of livestock vaccination are key for reducing human disease risk. This work represents a collaboration between public health and animal health agencies, a farmers’ association, and researchers, initiated from the start of the epidemic. Delays in getting livestock data occurred due to tropical storms and fieldwork constraints in remote areas. Nevertheless, we addressed in practice the challenges of a quantitative One Health approach (
