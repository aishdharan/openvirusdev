<p>During the study period, livestock sera were sampled by field veterinarians according to two protocols: RVF targeted surveys around human cases and the regular annual surveillance campaign (Système d’Epidémiosurveillance Animale à Mayotte [SESAM]), which has been implemented since 2008 (

However, due to the rapidly increasing number of human cases and logistics constraints, the Veterinary Services instead requested field veterinarians to sample animals from the annual surveillance campaign only; hence relatively few samples were collected from the targeted survey. In total, between July 2018 and June 2019, a total of 1,169 livestock sera were collected (1,023 from the annual surveillance and 146 from human investigations) and tested against RVF IgG [ID Screen RVF Competition ELISA; IDVet; Se = 97%, Sp = 100% (
