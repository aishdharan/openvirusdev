<p>We adapted the previously developed susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered model of RVFV transmission among Mayotte livestock (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) to the current epidemiological context. We kept the previous underlying demographic livestock population age structure (10 yearly age groups), and we used a discrete-time deterministic framework, with a daily time step. In the previous model, the transmission parameter among livestock

 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) at a daily time step, since the model time step and the human epidemic curve available for fitting had a smaller time resolution. We also included a lag of 14 d between rainfall and its impact on the vector abundance (
