 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), this corresponded to an average of 7,442 persons being seropositive. Assuming that the sizes of the 2007–2008 and 2018–2019 epidemics were similar (as seroprevalence data from livestock suggest), then 143 cases in the 2018–2019 epidemics would be correspond to a reporting fraction of 1.9% (95% CI [1.4–2.6]). Finally, input rainfall data were downloaded from the Meteofrance website, as cumulated rainfall over 10-d periods (
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Daily rainfall was calculated by dividing these values by 10 over each 10-d period.
