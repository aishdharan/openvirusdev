<p>Urban YF, transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> vector, was a severe threat to Brazilâ€™s human health until 1942 when the last case was registered in Acre state [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nowadays, the virus is maintained in the sylvatic cycle involving Neotropical non-human primates (NHP) and sylvatic mosquitoes (
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> spp.) [
