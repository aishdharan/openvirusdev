<p>The rapid spread and the extent of the latest recent YF outbreaks in the Southeast region, including highly densely populated urban centers in the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Espírito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], have raised concerns regarding YFV reintroduction in epidemiologically receptive areas, with millions of naïve people for YFV. NHP is the primary host of the YF sylvatic cycle, and even though NHP are mostly observed in rural/sylvatic zones, these animals are commonly found in urban-rural transition and urban areas in Brazil. Given the high numbers of epizootics during YF outbreaks, this study aimed at the molecular investigation of YFV in NHP from Minas Gerais. Our results showed the widespread occurrence of YFV in Minas Gerais and, hastily, YFV in NHP carcasses collected inside urban matrixes and urban-rural transition areas, including large urban centers.
