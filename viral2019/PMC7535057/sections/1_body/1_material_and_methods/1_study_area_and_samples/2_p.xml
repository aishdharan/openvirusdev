<p>The NHP carcasses were collected in the field by health surveillance agents (Brazilian Yellow Fever Surveillance Program [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], frozen (-20 °C), and transported to the Laboratory of Zoonosis of Belo Horizonte/Minas Gerais (LZOON-BH). At LZOON-BH, NHP carcasses were defrosted and visually inspected regarding the stage of decomposition, taking into account different tissue aspects: (
 <italic>i</italic>) brightness (bright or opaque); (
 <italic>ii</italic>) color (regular aspect, greenish, greyish or whitish); (
 <italic>iii</italic>) consistency (if the tissue was firm or softened); (
 <italic>iv</italic>) smell (whether the carcass was smelling rotten or not); and (
 <italic>v</italic>) presence or absence of parasites (larvae). Based on that, liver samples were categorized according to their preservation status: good (n = 465; 59.5%), intermediate (n = 211; 27.0%), or bad (n = 59; 7.5%). After defrosting, liver fragments (0.5 cm) were collected from the carcasses and placed into microtubes containing RNA later solution (Ambion, USA) by the LZOON team. The microtubes were kept at 4 °C for 16 hours and then stored at -20 °C until used for RNA extraction at Laboratório de Vírus/Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG).
