<p>Using the information on the address or geographic coordinates where carcasses were collected, each carcass was classified based on land use: urban (built-up) areas, urban-rural transition areas, and rural/sylvatic areas. Urban areas (built-up) corresponded to cities, towns, and villages or isolated urban areas, characterized by transformations resulting from urban development (e.g., paved streets, electric lighting, sewerage, buildings, and intense human occupation) [

The rural/sylvatic areas covered the entire area located outside these limits. Each localization of carcasses was checked using satellite imagery (Google Maps, available at
