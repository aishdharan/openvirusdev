<p>Total RNA was extracted from approximately 30 mg of the liver preserved in RNA later solution (Ambion, USA), using RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen, USA). RNA extraction was performed in batches of 11 samples plus one negative control (nuclease-free water). RNA samples were submitted to a one-step real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), with primers targeting the gene coding for β-actin [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], using GoTaq 1-Step RT-qPCR System (Promega, USA). All samples were positive, showing the suitability of samples for RT-qPCR. RNA samples and the negative extraction controls were screened in duplicate for YFV RNA using RT-qPCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Non-template (nuclease-free water) and YFV 17DD RNA (provided by Bio-Manguinhos/FIOCRUZ) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Samples were considered positive when they presented amplification in duplicate, considering the threshold for cycle quantification value (Cq) of 37. Since between the range of 37–40 Cq indicate minimal quantities of DNA, with low confidence for the results, Cqs&gt;37 or undetermined were considered negative. The results of RT-qPCR runs were manually inspected for the correction of baseline and threshold parameters whenever necessary due to heterogeneity in the amount of input RNA among different samples.
