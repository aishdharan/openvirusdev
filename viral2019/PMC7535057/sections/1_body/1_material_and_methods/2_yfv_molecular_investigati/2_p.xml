<p>The Cqs are inversely proportional to the input target nucleic acid in the sample, which could indirectly reflect the YFV genomic load in the samples. In that way, we performed a quantitative RT-qPCR (Bio Gene Research Febre Amarela PCR kitâ€”Bioclin-Quibasa, Brazil) using RNA obtained from 28 YFV-positive samples to have an estimative of YFV genomic load in the liver. We determined the number of genomic copies per gram (gc/g) of the liver, and we estimated the genomic loads in all YFV-positive carcasses using linear regression and the observed Cqs.</p>
