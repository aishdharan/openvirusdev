<p>From 11 YFV-positive samples, a partial sequence of the envelope gene (primers 5-left and 6-right) was obtained [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], using the GoTaq Hot Start Colorless Master Mix (Promega, USA). The amplicons were purified and sequenced with the ABI3130 platform (Applied Biosystems, USA). The consensus sequences were generated (Geneious v.9.1.6â€”Biomatters, NZL;
