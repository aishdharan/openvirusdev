<p>Partial nucleotide sequences of the envelope gene of 11 samples were obtained (Genbank accession numbers: MN517211-MN517221) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008658.s005">S2 Table</xref>), confirming wild-type YFV in NHP carcasses from urban and rural areas of different municipalities of Minas Gerais state. Phylogenetic analysis, involving 112 nucleotide (nt) sequences (621 nt) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008658.s006">S3 Table</xref>), indicated that YFV isolates obtained here formed a monophyletic cluster together with other YFV isolates from 2016 to 2018, within South America genotype I (
