<p>YFV infection was confirmed in 298 out of 781 carcasses (38.1%, 95% CI = 34.7–41.6%). Regardless the preservation status of the carcasses, all samples were analyzed, and YFV RNA was detected in the liver of carcasses in bad (16/59, 27.1%, 95% CI = 17.4–39.6%), intermediate (85/211, 40.2%, 95% CI = 33.9–47.0%) or good (187/465, 40.2%, 95% CI = 35.6–44.7%) preservation status. No association between the preservation status of carcasses and YFV RNA detection was observed (
