An extremely high OR (OR = 14.63, 95% CI = 5.80–36.91, p&lt; 0.0001) was observed for YFV detection in December /January followed by February/March (OR = 14.63, 95% CI = 2.00–12.35, p&lt; 0.0001). The detection of YFV RNA was negatively associated with the last bimester of the epidemic period (Apr/May) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008658.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). No difference was observed between the proportions of YFV-infected carcasses collected in 2017 (n = 155/397; 39.0%, 95% CI = 34.3–43.9%) and 2018 (n = 126/384; 32.8%; 95% CI = 28.3–37.6%) (
