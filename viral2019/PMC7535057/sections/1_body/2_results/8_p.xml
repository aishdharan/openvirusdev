<p>Since Cqs reflect the YFV genomic load in liver samples, we analyzed the median Cq values for YFV-positive samples. There was no difference in median Cqs observed in carcasses in good versus intermediate conservation status (

 </sup> = 9.08, p&lt; 0.010), carcasses in bad conservation status were discarded from this analysis, and only results obtained from carcasses in good and intermediate conservation status were considered. A negative linear regression was observed, and a significant equation was obtained [10E (-0.2986 x Cq + 13.5094)] (R
