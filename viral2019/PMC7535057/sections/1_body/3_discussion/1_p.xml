<p>From late 2016 to 2019, Southeast Brazil faced large and extensive sylvatic YF outbreaks, with thousands of human cases and epizootics, especially in MG state [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Based on demand for YFV investigation, we received liver samples belonging to NHP carcasses from January/2017 to December/2018. NHP are the primary hosts of the sylvatic YF cycle, and to better understand viral circulation in Minas Gerais state during recent outbreaks, we investigated YFV RNA in NHP carcasses. YFV was detected with high overall positivity of 38% in specimens of

 <italic>Callicebus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sapajus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic>. We observed the widespread circulation of YFV in Minas Gerais, detecting the virus in 49 municipalities where YF was not previously reported during the recent YF outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In Minas Gerais state, the mesoregions with the highest numbers of YFV-positive carcasses were the same ones with the highest records of human YF cases from 2016 to 2018 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our phylogenetic analyses confirmed the YFV in different urban areas of Minas Gerais, close to human populations. Besides, the YFV detected in urban and rural environments belonged to the same lineage, indicating the dissemination of YFV from rural/sylvatic towards the urban areas during the recent YF outbreaks.
