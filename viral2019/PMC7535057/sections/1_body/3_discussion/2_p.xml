<p>A gradient of YFV dissemination was observed from rural towards urban-rural interface and urban areas, in conformity with the sylvatic pattern of YF [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], when one would expect a higher exposure to the virus in rural environments. According to the seasonal pattern, a higher positivity for YFV infection was observed during the epidemic periods, when a more extensive transmission of the virus and a higher number of cases would likely occur [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our data indicate the period from December to March with the highest chances of YFV detection in NHP carcasses, what should be considered by the YF surveillance system, and strengthening the surveillance, especially at the beginning of the epidemic period. Nevertheless, the YFV circulation during the non-epidemic period of 2017 was confirmed here and by official bulletins [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], followed by a decline by mid-2018 until 2019 [
