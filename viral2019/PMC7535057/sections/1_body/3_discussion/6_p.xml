<p>Although NHP have a crucial role in the epidemiology of YF and despite YFV-infected NHP in urban areas, there was no documented case of urban/
 <italic>Aedes</italic> transmission of YFV in Brazil since 1942 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The lower viral load (represented by the estimated viral genomic load) in urban NHP could lower the chances for further viral transmission to vectors. Besides, the closure of some parks in urban centers, the vaccination of humans, and the distinct behavior patterns and habitats observed for hosts (NHP and humans) and vectors in urban areas might have played a role in preventing the urban/
 <italic>Aedes</italic> transmission of YFV to humans. However, the high infestation of Brazilian urban areas by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> poses a risk for YFV urban/
 <italic>Aedes</italic> transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Concerning

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, although the latter has shown low transmission competency to YFV [
