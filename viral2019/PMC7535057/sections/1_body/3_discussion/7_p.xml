<p>Here we demonstrated the wide occurrence of YFV-infected NHP in Minas Gerais state, including several urban areas, during the epidemic and non-epidemic periods. Although the number of YFV-infected NHP and humans dramatically decreased from the mid-2018, YFV persisted in the Southeast region [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], at least during three consecutive transmission seasons [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008658.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These data reinforce that YFV has suitable ecological and climate conditions for its maintenance in Southeast Brazil. Further studies to investigate the sensitivity of urban NHP and the competence of YFV vectors found in urban and urban-rural transition areas should be conducted to understand better the dynamics of YF and the risks for the occurrence of YF in urban centers.
