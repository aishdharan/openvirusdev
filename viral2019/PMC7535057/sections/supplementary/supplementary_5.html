 <caption> Characteristics of non-human primate carcasses used for yellow fever virus investigation. (A) Balloon plot of observed frequencies (freq) of NHP carcasses related to the year (2017 and 2018) and the sampling period. Epi: epidemic period (December to May), non-epi: non-epidemic period (June to November). (B) Balloon plot of observed frequencies (freq) of NHP carcasses related to the genera Alouatta, Callicebus, Callithrix, or non-identified specimens (Non-ID), and the environment rural, urban-rural interface (UR-I), or urban areas. Balloon plots were created using Rand; each cell contains a dot whose size and color reflect the relative magnitude of the corresponding component, according to the frequencies presented. (C) Distribution of NHP carcasses according to the epidemiological weeks, in 2017 (left) and 2018 (right). YFV-positive samples are shown in red, and samples non-detectable for YFV RNA by RT-qPCR [ 24] are shown in blue. Epidemic periods, in 2017 and 2018, correspond to epidemiological weeks 1 to 22 and 49 to 52 of each year. (TIF) </caption>
