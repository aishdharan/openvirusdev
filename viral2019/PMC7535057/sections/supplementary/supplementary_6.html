 <caption> Association between detection of yellow fever virus (YFV) in the liver of non-human primate carcasses with each bimester within the yellow fever epidemic and non-epidemic periods. YFV ND: yellow fever virus RNA non-detectable. YFV pos: yellow fever virus RNA detectable. Pearson residuals (standardized) were extracted from the chi-square function and plotted. In each cell, the circleâ€™s size is proportional to the amount of cell contribution, and colors indicate positive residuals (blue) or negative residuals (red). The vertical bars indicate Pearson residuals values. Analyses were run in R software v.3.6.0. (TIF) </caption>
