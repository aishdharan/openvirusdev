<p>Besides the ongoing pandemic, Bangladesh faced the onslaught of dengue last year (2019) with 2020 season expected to start in June, a viral infection caused by four types of viruses (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) from the Flaviviridae family. These viruses are typically transmitted infected 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> female mosquitoes. These mosquitoes thrive in areas withstanding water, including puddles, water tanks, containers, and old tires. The lack of reliable sanitation and regular garbage collection also contribute to the spread of the mosquitoes. Dengue infection could be asymptomatic, which makes it highly transmissible. Generally, the infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms including multiple waves of sudden high fevers, which may progress to the Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) [
