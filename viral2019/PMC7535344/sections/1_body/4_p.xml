<p>With the onset of the monsoon season expected between the end of May to September, the density of Aedes population is predicted to rise. The construction sites are considered as the main sources of Aedes breeding as well as the currently idle terminal stations. If the dengue epidemic spreads at a similar rate of the COVID-19, it would be impossible to equip health facilities to treat patients suffering from both the COVID-19 and the DHF. In overcrowded health facilities, maintaining social distance would be challenging. Although the number of tests has increased over the last few weeks, the rate of test conducted is still 3242 tests per million (as of 16 June 2020), which is insufficient for a country with around 161.4 million population. The scenario would get worse due to the similar nature of symptoms for these two diseases. The delay of identifying the sources of flu-like symptoms, be it from dengue fever or coronavirus, would affect treatment speed as well as recovery rate.</p>
