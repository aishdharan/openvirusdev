 <italic>Skin rashes in newborns of COVID‐19‐infected mothers</italic> were reported in two boys out of four infants from China. 
 <italic>Maculopapular rash</italic> scattered throughout the body was observed in one of the boys who was not tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. The rash resolved rapidly without treatment and was followed by desquamation. 
 <italic>Ulcerated facial skin</italic> on the forehead was detected in the other boy who was proven to be SARS‐CoV‐2 negative. Lesions were quickly followed by diffuse red papules that spontaneously healed within 10 days. None of the four newborns of COVID‐19‐infected mothers developed disease, and no vertical transmission was detected.
