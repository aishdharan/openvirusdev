<p>A prospective nationwide consensus study conducted among dermatologists in Spain summarized clinical data and images of 375 confirmed or suspected COVID‐19 cases with cutaneous manifestations. Based on this case collection survey, the authors suggested five cutaneous clinical patterns and several subpatterns associated with COVID‐19, as well as few familial clusters. Lesions were classified as acral erythema with vesicles or pustules (pseudo‐chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%), and livedo or necrosis (6%). It was also pointed out that the separate types of skin involvement appeared at various points of the disease course and were associated with different duration, severity, and prognosis. This classification might be helpful in recognition of paucisymptomatic patients, epidemiological control, and prognostic evaluation.
