<p>Cutaneous involvement during the COVID‐19 disease was estimated to be 0.2% in China where only two patients of 1,099 with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection presented with “skin rash” without further characteristics.

 </xref> In Italy, the range of reported skin manifestations reached 20.4%, given that 18 of 88 COVID‐19 patients had it. They presented with erythematous rash (14 patients), widespread urticarial lesions (three patients), and chickenpox‐like vesicles (one patient). The lesions were asymptomatic or slightly pruritic and affected mainly the trunk. They appeared at the onset of the infection or in the course of hospitalization and were healing within a few days. As no correlation with the disease severity was found, a nonspecific character was presumed.

 </xref> In a French prospective study on the incidence and types of COVID‐19‐associated cutaneous manifestations, skin involvement was reported in only 4.9% (five patients of 103) and presented as erythematous rash (two patients) and urticaria (two patients). Lesions appeared during the illness or the prodromal phase, affected mainly the face and upper part of the body, were pruritic, and resolved between 24 hours and 6 days. The authors concluded that cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 were unusual and mostly nonspecific.
