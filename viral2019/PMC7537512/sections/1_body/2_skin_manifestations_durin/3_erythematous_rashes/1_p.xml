 <italic>Morbilliform rash</italic> as a presenting symptom of COVID‐19 was reported in a 20‐year‐old previously healthy man from the USA. Extensive maculopapular and nonpruritic lesions on the trunk and extremities were consistent with viral exanthema. The patient demonstrated both positive SARS‐CoV‐2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and bilateral multifocal pneumonia on chest radiograph.

 <italic>Asymptomatic malar erythema and slight edema</italic> were described in another 26‐year‐old man from the USA who was treated with adalimumab 40 mg biweekly for Crohn’s disease in remission. This patient was not tested, but his condition followed a contact with SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected persons. The skin eruption was preceded by general symptoms of infection and resolved within 20 days. It was considered a typical viral exanthema with a possible clinical modification by the adalimumab treatment, the latter being on hold until the patient’s full recovery.

 <italic>Symmetrical drug‐related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE)‐like</italic> erythematous rash was observed in a 64‐year‐old diabetic woman from France. She took oral paracetamol for fever and asthenia and 4 days later developed an erythematous rash on both antecubital fossae that further extended to the trunk and axillary folds. The patient was positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA by PCR and chest computed tomography. The rash resolved within 5 days without paracetamol discontinuation. Relation to the infection was discussed as SDRIFE has previously been associated with both drug intake and viral infection, primarily parvovirus B19.
