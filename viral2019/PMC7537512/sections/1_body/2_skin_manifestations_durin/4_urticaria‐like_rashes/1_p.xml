 <italic>Urticaria‐like rash</italic> was documented in another 32‐year‐old woman with COVID‐19 from Spain. Skin lesions appeared 6 days after the onset of symptoms and faded under oral antihistamines in another 5 days. In contrast to previous reports, histologic examination has been performed and revealed a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, some eosinophils, and edema in the upper dermis. The authors considered the rash nonspecific and prospectively observed other cases of maculopapular rash, some of them with a purpuric component, and urticaria.

 <italic>Urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, idiopathic plantar hidradenitis, or neutrophilic dermatosis</italic> was considered in the differential diagnosis of another COVID‐19 case from Spain. A 28‐year‐old woman without previous medical history complained of pruritic erythematous‐yellowish papules on both heels that further enlarged to erythematous patches and hardened. The lesions appeared during her reconvalescence period and 10 days after the last paracetamol intake. A biopsy was not performed, but the skin changes could be related to the viral infection or patient’s immune response.
