 <italic>Varicella‐like papulovesicular exanthema</italic> was reported in a series of 22 patients from Italy as a rare but specific cutaneous manifestation of COVID‐19. The rash developed on average within 3 days after systemic symptoms and affected mostly men with median age of 60 years. Lesions predominantly affected the trunk, and mild itching was reported in 40% of the patients. Histology was consistent with viral infection. The lesions regressed within 8 days without scarring.

 </xref> Another prospective observational study from Spain including 24 patients with COVID‐19‐related vesicular rashes suggested two presentation patterns, diffuse and localized, respectively. The diffuse pattern was polymorphic, widespread, and resembling hand‐foot‐mouth disease, while the localized was monomorphic, involving mostly the trunk, and resembling chickenpox. In this series, COVID‐19 vesicular rashes also developed mostly after the onset of typical COVID‐19 symptoms. Their histological presentation was consistent with viral infection. PCR tests failed to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 inside the vesicles so the direct relation to the virus itself remains unclear.
