 <italic>Dengue‐like rash</italic> was reported in a single case from Taiwan, the second country, affected by COVID‐19 with 48 patients detected at that time. Neither photographs were made nor skin biopsy was performed since it was not a routine practice according to the dengue clinical practice guideline. The patient further developed respiratory problems and was confirmed COVID‐19 positive by real‐time PCR.

 <italic>Petechial rash</italic> was also observed in Spain, where an 84‐year‐old woman with arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia was treated with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir for bilateral COVID‐19 pneumonia. Three days after her hospitalization (11 days since the onset of COVID‐19 symptoms), she developed slightly pruritic, mostly periaxillary, erythemo‐purpuric, coalescing macules. Either the triggering role of the infection itself or the drug intake was discussed.
