 <italic>Livedo reticularis</italic> was reported in two mild COVID‐19‐positive cases from the USA. Both patients, a 67‐year‐old man and 47‐year‐old woman, experienced unilateral, nonpruritic net‐like rash which resolved within 19 hours and 20 minutes, respectively. The skin lesions appeared about a week after infection onset and did not reappear on challenge. It was suggested that microthromboses such as in DIC may cause transient livedo in mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 cases or acrocyanosis in critically ill patients.

 </xref> Later, in three of five critically ill SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients from the USA presenting with retiform and purpuric lesions, a generalized thrombotic microvascular injury was detected in both pulmonary and cutaneous biopsies. Histological tests from cutaneous lesions and normal‐appearing skin revealed a pauci‐inflammatory complement‐mediated microthrombotic disease with C5b‐9 and C4d deposition.
