<p>In an online registry launched by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) in collaboration with the International League of Dermatological Societies (ILDS), all patients with skin lesions during or following COVID‐19 can be reported (Table

 </xref> The primary purpose is to rapidly collect dermatologic manifestations of COVID‐19 in order to enable prompt dissemination of the information to the dermatology community and frontline healthcare workers. Similar registries based on the submission of downloadable forms have been initiated by the French and Spanish dermatological societies. These registries will certainly help to describe the whole spectrum of COVID‐19‐related skin changes. Systematic studies on dermatoses during acute COVID‐19 may not be expected within the near future and are certainly hampered by the most likely benign course of these skin changes and the lack of involvement of dermatologists in the acute treatment of COVID‐19.
