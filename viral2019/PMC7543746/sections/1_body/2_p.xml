<p id="para0003">Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children causing an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year across the globe. Because of vaccination, more than 21 million lives have been saved and measles deaths have been reduced by 80% since 2000. Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine for the last fifty years, many countries around the world still experience measles outbreaks. As of 5 November 2019, there have been 413,308 confirmed measles cases reported to the World Health Organization including more than 110,000 and 140,000 deaths due to measles in 2017 and 2018 respectively.
