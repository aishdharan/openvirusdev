<p id="para0009">During the current pandemic situation, there may be three important considerations related to the decline in the number of reported measles cases. First, as the measles is also respiratory disease, the strict implementation of preventive measures such as use of mask, frequent hand washing, use of sanitizers, social distancing and ban on public gatherings helped to prevent the measles virus transmission along with the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The same strategy adopted to combat COVID-19 spreadmay also helped to prevent the transmission of other respiratory infections including tuberculosis, influenza and pneumococcal disease which is already reported by the previous studies.
