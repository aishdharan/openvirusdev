<p>For the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, nasopharyngeal swab samples from suspected patients were subjected to the cobas® 6,800 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test using the fully automated cobas® 6,800 (Roche). The test was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample was performed using target-specific primers (forward and reverse) for amplifying two regions; ORF1 and the structural protein envelope E-gene of SARS-CoV-2. The reported patient cycle threshold (Ct) value was 22.3 which was considered as positive with high viral load.
