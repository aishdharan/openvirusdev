<p>The result of this case study is significant in that it suggests that natural infection leads to induction of protection against the virus, at the humoral level. The development of antibodies after infection with COVID-19 is now well-established, however, the appearance of antibodies does not always correlate with a rapid decline in viral load. Normally, in 50% of young to middle-aged COVID-19 patients without underlying major disease, seroconversion occurs 7 days subsequent to infection (

It would, therefore, be interesting to test for memory humoral immunity in recovered patients. This would also support the idea that recovered patients' immune response has the capacity to develop persistent antibody production that may help to counter the virus. It also suggests a correlation of protection (from reinfection) with antibody response, and possibly with other cellular components. The vital role of cellular immune response to the virus has been proven in a recent study, wherein, it was found that the extent and degree of memory T cell response from convalescent patients with COVID-19 appeared to be higher in severe compared to mild cases (
