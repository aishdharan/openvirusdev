<p>This case report is the first in humans to show that a recovered patient who had been infected with the novel SARS CoV-2 was protected from reinfection. However, further studies are warranted on a large cohort of COVID-19 recovered patients. This finding may add to the existing concept of protection with convalescent plasma therapy and encourage the scientific community in its renewed efforts in understanding the immune system's interaction with the virus towards development of a successful vaccine.</p>
