The overall goal is to reduce new diagnoses by 75% within 5 years and by 90% within 10 years [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Targets include diagnosis of 95% of people (persons) with HIV (PWH), 95% of whom have viral suppression; and 50% of persons at increased risk for HIV acquisition are prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Coordinated and fortified efforts, focusing on diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and response, prioritize 50 local jurisdictions (48 counties, the District of Columbia, and San Juan, Puerto Rico) with the highest number of new HIV diagnoses, and 7 states having substantial rural diagnoses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

In 2018 alone [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], 37 515 persons were newly diagnosed, who were disproportionately African American and Hispanic/Latinx. Male-male sexual contact &#x000b1; injection drug use accounted for most of these (70%), followed by heterosexual contact (24%) and injection drug use alone (7%). By age group, diagnoses rates were highest among 20- to 34-year-olds. This brings the total number of PWH in the United States to an estimated 1.2 million, 14% of whom are undiagnosed [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although 64% have received some HIV medical care, 49% are retained in continuous care and just 53% have viral suppression [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, approximately 38% of HIV transmission occurs from undiagnosed persons, 43% from those who are diagnosed but not in care, and 20% from those in care who are not virally suppressed [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The epidemic&#x02019;s epicenter has shifted from the coastal urban centers to the Southern United States [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: home to approximately 50% of persons who are newly diagnosed, living, or dying with HIV; where the HIV knowledge and health of PWH is below the national average; and where various regional disparities are rampant, driven by pervasive economic, cultural, social, structural, and geopolitical factors [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this study, we examine the HIV epidemic and control efforts in Texas, the second largest and second most populous US state, against a backdrop of the epidemic&#x02019;s history in Houston, its largest city.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>HIV THROUGH THE AGES IN HOUSTON: INSIDERS&#x02019; ACCOUNT</title><sec id="s3"><title>Early Years (1970s&#x02013;1985)</title><p>Houston&#x02019;s first health initiative for men who have sex with men (MSM) was launched by a gay activist, Ray Hill, who created and distributed a trifold flyer about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in gay bars during the 1960s [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Later, &#x0201c;Dan the VD Man,&#x0201d; from the Houston Health Department, pioneered (mobile) STI testing at gay bars in 1976, followed in 1978 by &#x0201c;Mother Ruth&#x0201d; Ravas [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The Montrose Clinic (currently, Legacy Community Health Services) became established in 1978 as a grassroots organization to test and treat MSM for STIs, alongside the Montrose Counseling Center (currently, the Montrose Center) for mental health services, through the efforts of twin gay physicians, Robert and Richard O&#x02019;Brien [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both of these institutions evolved and thrived, providing crucial prevention, care and support services to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community and PWH. Their board members founded the AIDS Foundation Houston in 1982, the earliest Texas organization dedicated to prevention education and services [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In 1981, the first case of gay-related immune deficiency disease ([GRID] currently, AIDS) was diagnosed in Houston, followed by 7 others, mostly white MSM, only 2 of whom survived by the year-end [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Next year, Houston&#x02019;s LGBTQ newspaper, the Montrose Voice [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], published a supplement titled &#x0201c;Sexually Transmitted Diseases,&#x0201d; focused on Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma (KS). The supplement reported that 53 men with suspected immunodeficiency were screened at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and found to have cellular immunodeficiency and high risk of developing the &#x0201c;new gay disease,&#x0201d; with 4 men receiving treatment for KS [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Concurrently, Houston&#x02019;s community physicians cared for many terminally ill MSM. Notable early pioneers included Didier Piot, who had provided care for Ga&#x000eb;tan Dugas in Toronto in 1978, a flight attendant for Air Canada (erroneously termed &#x0201c;Patient 0&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], Rodger Frasier, Paul Gustafson, Patrick McNamara, Patricia Salvato, and Shannon Schrader.</p><p>These and other reports fueled the parallel epidemics of fear and stigma. When the first commercial HIV test became available in 1985 [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the Montrose Clinic was inundated with testing requests. Different agencies sprung up to provide patients with assistance (eg, food pantry [Stone Soup], residential hostel [McAdory House], hospice [Omega House], numerous charitable organizations, and fundraisers), alongside support venues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Top). However, these efforts and resources were severely outpaced by the epidemic&#x02019;s sheer scale and pace [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>(Top) Mary&#x02019;s bar located on Westheimer Avenue in Houston was a prominent place of support and family for the community.

At the public MDACC, there was an explosive increase in the volume of AIDS patients in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Here, Peter Mansell and Guy Newell, physicians in the department of cancer prevention, spearheaded AIDS prevention studies and public education efforts [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on the prevailing healthcare needs and opportunities, American Medical International Inc. (AMI), a for-profit hospital corporation that owned 11 hospitals in Houston, successfully proposed to the University of Texas (UT) System and MDACC, the conversion of AMI&#x02019;s Citizens General Hospital to a unique, freestanding, dedicated AIDS hospital [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Predicated on such a facility, and with Peter Mansell as the principal investigator and coinvestigators including Evan Hersh, James Reuben, Blaine Hollinger, and UT Health Science Center School of Public Health (Dean, R. Palmer Beasley), MDACC became a recipient of the first 14 AIDS Treatment and Evaluation Unit (ATEU) Grants countrywide. The 5-year ($5.8 million) grant was awarded for both basic science and clinical AIDS research, by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, the nation&#x02019;s first AIDS hospital, the Institute for Immunological Disorders, opened on August 1, 1986, under the leadership of Peter Mansell (medical director), Daniel Moreschi (operations), and Adan Rios (clinical research) [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Grounded in MDACC&#x02019;s philosophy of cancer care, the Institute pioneered the now established, outpatient model for HIV care and paved the way for humane treatment and development of therapies for HIV and related malignancies [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unfortunately, the Institute was shut down by AMI, just 15 months later, on December 11, 1987, due to heavy financial loss ($8 million) and dire operational challenges [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The drivers for this included the following: Institute&#x02019;s inconvenient location and difficult transportation (~20 miles from inner city and MDACC); disrepute of Citizens General Hospital; inadequate support from local community, private practitioners, and public health officials; meager resources for indigent patients; and underutilization of inpatient services due to an outpatient-, home-, and/or hospice-based model of care [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This shutdown was not only a major setback for Houston&#x02019;s AIDS response but also a fatal blow to the Houston ATEU. The MDACC did not revive its former AIDS clinic nor did any other medical institution step forward, to enable ATEU&#x02019;s continued operation [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, MDACC returned the residual grant funds ($4 million) to the NIH, leaving the epicenter Houston without an ATEU, and branding the city with a bad track record and the state with a nonserious reputation about AIDS [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Subsequently, MDACC swapped its Railroad Hospital on Thomas Street, with land at Holcombe Street owned by the Harris County Hospital District ([HCHD] currently named the Harris Health System). Thus, the Thomas Street Hospital for AIDS patients was created in 1989, that later became established as the Thomas Street Health Center (TSHC) [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The late Robert Awe, a pulmonologist at the Baylor College of Medicine, was a long-time AIDS activist, founder of Omega House (hospice), and medical director of HCHD&#x02019;s Jefferson Davis Hospital (closed since 1991) and its AIDS clinic, the city&#x02019;s first [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As an advocate for accessible and high-quality indigent care [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], he declined to direct TSHC upon its inception, to draw attention to insufficient commitment of funds and personnel [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Also in 1989, the Montrose Clinic formed the Houston Clinical Research Network, for clinical research and access to investigational drugs, as 1 of 12 sites sponsored by the American Foundation for AIDS Research ([amfAR] currently named The Foundation for AIDS Research) [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the Annual Houston Conference on AIDS in America was launched to keep Houston&#x02019;s AIDS community engaged and apprised with the national AIDS scene. This conference was organized by Houston physicians (Adan Rios [director], Gordon Crofoot [codirector], Gary Brewton, Benjamin Valfre, and Jorge Quesada), with collaboration from the City of Houston Bureau of Business and Conventions (director, Don Ward), and management of International Meeting Managers (director, Lynn Tiras). The codiscoverer of HIV, Luc Montagnier [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], inaugurated both the first session in 1989 and the last held 11 years later. Martin Delaney [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the founder of Project Inform, a national HIV/AIDS organization for advocacy, treatment information, and public policy, attended this conference, where information was disseminated about new products and services. In addition, the Houston chapter of the NAMES project organized the AIDS Quilt exhibition here in 1990 at the George R. Brown Convention Center [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Former heavyweight champion George Foreman contributed substantially to Houston&#x02019;s AIDS welfare. He donated funds ($100 000) to the AIDS Foundation Houston (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Center) that, together with land donated by the city of Houston, led to the creation of a well stocked food pantry (Stone Soup) for AIDS patients that exists to this day [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Houston was 1 of 6 cities awarded funds from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention for HIV prevention, including health education, counseling and testing, public information and minority campaigns, plus support for community-based organizations (CBOs). The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act was enacted in 1990 to provide federal funds for HIV care [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Given the epidemic&#x02019;s severity, under the program&#x02019;s first year, Harris and 5 surrounding counties received $3.7 million in 1991, followed by continued substantial funding, which revolutionized HIV care in Houston and nationwide.</p><p>The first antiretroviral (ARV) drug, zidovudine (AZT), was approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987 [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Several other nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) ensued; however, the first protease inhibitor (PI), saquinavir, was not approved until December 1995, and AIDS deaths continued to rise in the United States including Texas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>New human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses, persons with HIV (PWH), and deaths among PWH in Texas (1980&#x02013;2019).

The availability of several PIs and non-NRTIs, alongside NRTIs, started the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and declining AIDS deaths, reported for the first time in 1996 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). That same year, the FDA approved the first home (over-the-counter) HIV test, urine HIV test, and in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid quantification (viral load) [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Subsequently, new and improved ARVs have become available for therapy in terms of the following: potency, tolerability, safety, and resistance barrier; fixed-dose drug combinations; and novel ARV generations and classes (including integrase strand transfer inhibitors). Advances in prevention include the milestone approval for ARV PrEP of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in 2012 [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Consequently, treatment and prevention paradigms have converged towards universal access, treatment as prevention, and combination prevention [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Disparities among PWH became apparent by 1996 that showed disproportionately high diagnoses among African Americans nationally. In 1999 [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], name-based HIV diagnosis reporting began in Texas and similar disparities were observed. These and other data prompted the US Congressional Black Caucus to create the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI). Thus, Houston/Harris County began to receive MAI funding besides Ryan White Title I. The Expanded Testing Initiative, introduced in 2007, helped establish routine, opt-out HIV screening in hospitals and community health centers throughout Harris County [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and a standard nonrapid approach was proven feasible, in a busy urban emergency department [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In 2010, the first US National HIV/AIDS Strategy [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS &#x0201c;Getting to Zero&#x0201d; Strategy were created [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Subsequently, Houston showcased innovation through various demonstration projects, including the Enhanced Comprehensive HIV Prevention Planning Project (intensify and focus HIV prevention&#x02019;s impact), Project PrIDE (PrEP awareness and using surveillance data for care re-engagement), and Project Con&#x000e9;ctate (molecular cluster detection and response) [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;42</xref>]. The above have substantially augmented the HIV prevention and care efforts in Houston.</p><p>On the societal front, in the 2003 landmark civil rights case, Lawrence v. Texas, the US Supreme Court struck down the sodomy law in Texas in a 6 to 3 decision and, by extension, invalidated sodomy laws in 13 other states, legalizing same-sex sexual activity across the nation [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Bottom). This ruling not only supported the civil rights and emancipation of the LGBTQ community, but it also facilitated the historic legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015. Nevertheless, PWH have been prosecuted in Texas for HIV exposure under criminal laws, including attempted murder and aggravated assault, with consideration of bodily fluids as a deadly weapon because of HIV-positive status [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

HIV positivity per se does not increase the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, morbidity, or mortality, and some ARVs may even be protective [<xref rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]; however, many PWH belong to demographic groups or have comorbidities that heighten the risk of infection, morbidity, and/or mortality due to COVID-19 [<xref rid="CIT0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The pandemic has severely disrupted the healthcare infrastructure that PWH use, with as-yet unknown implications [<xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Furthermore, it has overwhelmingly diverted the national and local resources, including those of the health departments in Texas and elsewhere, for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the pandemic provides an opportunity for expediting HIV-differentiated service delivery [<xref rid="CIT0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The EHE is a laudable initiative. Lessons learned, precise target-gap knowledge, intervention-demand creation, financial and political commitment, and coordinated implementation of strategies will be crucial for ending HIV in Texas.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>PATIENT CONSENT STATEMENT</title><p>We have permission from the owners of the photographs shown for publication herein.
