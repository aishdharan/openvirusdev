<p>Despite incredible progress against HIV, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses in the United States has remained steady for over a decade, and since the first case report in 1981, approximately 700 000 persons have died [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2018 alone [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], 37 515 persons were newly diagnosed, who were disproportionately African American and Hispanic/Latinx. Male-male sexual contact Â± injection drug use accounted for most of these (70%), followed by heterosexual contact (24%) and injection drug use alone (7%). By age group, diagnoses rates were highest among 20- to 34-year-olds. This brings the total number of PWH in the United States to an estimated 1.2 million, 14% of whom are undiagnosed [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although 64% have received some HIV medical care, 49% are retained in continuous care and just 53% have viral suppression [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, approximately 38% of HIV transmission occurs from undiagnosed persons, 43% from those who are diagnosed but not in care, and 20% from those in care who are not virally suppressed [
