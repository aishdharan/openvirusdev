<p>In 2019, Houston signed with the Fast Track Cities Paris Declaration, an initiative that seeks to end the HIV epidemic by 2030 [
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This is a crucial commitment because despite control efforts, the Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area ranked 10th in rate of new HIV diagnoses in 2018 [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Harris County, which comprises most of Houston, is the third most populous US county, and it is ethnically diverse, predominantly (60%) African American and Hispanic/Latinx [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and an HIV hot spot [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2018, this county had the highest diagnoses in Texas (1193; rate, 25.4/100 000 population), and the annual numbers have remained similar since 2008 with cumulative 46 280 diagnoses [
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Here, there were 26 385 PWH in 2018 [
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], with almost 70% of diagnoses among those with male-male sexual contact and 25% with heterosexual contact, while injection drug use contributed another 4%–6% [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47–49</xref>]. Moreover, although HIV seropositivity is no longer a threat to immigration status [
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], immigration regulations and procedures [
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] are additional barriers to care and resource utilization for the more than 1.6 million immigrants living in the Houston metropolitan area [
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].
