<p>The diagnosis-based HIV care continuum for Texas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] compares favorably to the national continuum in terms of care receipt (76.1% vs 75.7%) and retention (58.2% vs 57.9%), although HIV viral suppression is lower (62.1% vs 64.7% among PWH and 81.6% vs 85.4% among persons with â‰¥1 viral load test) [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, much more effort is required to achieve the ambitious target of 95% viral suppression within 10 years in Texas and nationwide.
