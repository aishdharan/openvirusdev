<p>This stratagem requires rapid detection and response to emerging HIV molecular clusters and prevention of new infections. Drug resistance testing is recommended at entry into care for PWH [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although this may not be cost effective at the individual level [
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], resistance testing generates HIV-polymerase nucleotide sequence data that can be analyzed to determine genetically similar viral variants, infer transmission relationships, and identify growing clusters that represent ongoing transmission and potential recipients of public health interventions [
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Rapidly growing clusters have been detected across the United States, including Texas [
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Of the 76 confirmed and other cases in a substantial cluster during 2015–2016, 100% were male, 78% were aged 13–29 years, 87% were Hispanic, and 89% reported male-male sex. The lifetime sex partners were 2–300, with 24% reporting anonymous partners. An STI was diagnosed among 13% within 12 months before HIV. None had used PrEP. Overall, 41% had viral suppression within 6 months of HIV diagnosis, whereas 13% had never had a viral load test. High-risk sexual behavior, low PrEP availability, missed cases of acute HIV, and delayed viral suppression were associated with rapid growth of this cluster among young Hispanic MSM [
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. These data highlight the importance of cluster detection and response for focused HIV prevention and treatment.
