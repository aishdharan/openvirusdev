 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows a comparison of Harris County with select other EHE priority jurisdictions, in terms of core [
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and other indicators [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] from the following areas [
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]: policy and legal, socioeconomic, and service availability. Based on modeled forecasts, EHE scale-up of interventions is likely to be cost-saving in Houston/Harris County similar to other Southern hotspots such as Atlanta, Baltimore, and Miami [
 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, augmented scale-up [
 <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and differentiated service delivery [
 <xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] will be required for optimal results.
