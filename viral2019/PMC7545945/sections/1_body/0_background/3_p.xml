<p id="Par28">Recent demonstration projects in large metropolitan areas such as Atlanta (ATL), New Orleans (NO), San Francisco (SF) and Washington D.C. (DC) have demonstrated that rapid ART initiation is a promising strategy for earlier virologic suppression in clinical settings [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Each of these cities benefitted from citywide and statewide initiatives to end HIV that promote faster linkage, greater access to care, expedited clinic intake and increased fiscal resources for rapid initiation. Median time to virologic suppression following ART initiation in ATL, NO, and SF was 57 days, 30 days, and 43 days, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The Fast Forward (FF) pilot program in DC did not see a significant difference between time from diagnosis to viral suppression between individuals who were in the FF group compared to standard of care (SOC) (80.6% vs. 74.2%) [
