<p id="Par29">Barriers including poverty, housing insecurities and lack of health insurance impact linkage to care and can delay initiation of ART. Other structural barriers to rapid ART initiation include the absence of Medicaid expansion in the state of Mississippi and the process of approval for ART medications through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). The latter requires that new HIV diagnoses be registered in the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS) with documentation of CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load results which may take up to 14 days to be reported. These requirements can interfere with same-day access to HIV medications, especially for underinsured or uninsured individuals.</p>
