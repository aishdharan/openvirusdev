<p id="Par32">We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV who presented to OAHCC for HIV care and treatment from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. Patients either were diagnosed with HIV at OAHCC or referred for linkage to HIV treatment services from the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinic by a Disease Intervention Specialist after being notified of their HIV diagnosis. Initial clinic visits at OAHCC included clinical evaluation (i.e. nursing intake and phlebotomy), HIV-related education and counseling, enrollment in the Ryan White Part B program and ADAP, if applicable, and baseline laboratory tests. Patients were prescribed medication on the same day of their initial clinical visit when possible, depending on their expressed willingness and medication coverage. Uninsured patients were given access to medications through available medication samples or access through drug manufacturer medication assistance programs. The following variables were abstracted from the medical records by OAHCC staff during and included demographics, date of HIV diagnosis, date of first visit to a provider at OAHCC, risk factor(s) for HIV acquisition, drug use, insurance status and date of and results for initial and subsequent HIV viral load and CD4+â€‰T cell counts.</p>
