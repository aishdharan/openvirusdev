<p id="Par33">Rapid ART starters were defined as individuals who started ART within seven days of an initial HIV diagnosis; all others were classified as non-rapid starters. Manufacturer-funded drug assistance programs were used to provide immediate access to ART pending commercial insurance or ADAP approval at no additional cost to patients. Primary statistical analyses compared time from ART initiation to viral suppression amongst rapid ART starters and non-rapid starters. Secondary analyses were used to determine differences in time from diagnosis to viral suppression between the two groups as well as well as the effect time from diagnosis to treatment initiation had on viral suppression.</p>
