<p id="Par34">We compared outcomes data per year (2016–2018) and between groups. Viral suppression was defined as HIV RNA &lt; 200 copies/mL. Date of ART initiation was measured using the date patients received their first e-script. Continuous variables were compared using Mann–Whitney test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher’s exact test. Analyses were conducted using STATA SE 16.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). This study was reviewed and approved by University of Mississippi Medical Center’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p>
