<p id="Par35">During the evaluation time period, 70 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV were evaluated for treatment at OAHCC. Sixty-three patients were included in the analysis. Individuals who did not have a detectable viral load at their initial HIV care visit were excluded (n = 2). Five patients were excluded from the analysis because they transferred care immediately following diagnosis (n = 2) or they did not return for their initial visit for HIV care (n = 3). Of the patients who met the criteria for analysis, 27% were rapid ART starters.</p>
