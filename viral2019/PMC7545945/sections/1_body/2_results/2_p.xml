<p id="Par36">Demographic and behavioral characteristics of the sample population are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Majority of the sample were men (87%), identified as non-heterosexual (75%) and were Black/African American (91%). The median age was 27-years old (IQR, 20–61). Fifty-seven percent of patients (36/63) were uninsured and received Ryan White-funded HIV services; only 31% had commercial health insurance coverage. Mean baseline viral load was 337,280 (± 134, 1230) copies/mL and the mean CD4+ T cell count was 446 (± 290.25) cells/μl. Initial CD4+ T cell counts were found to be statistically significant in rapid starters compared to non-rapid starters (p = 0.009). There were no statistical differences for age, race, sex, sexual orientation, drug use or health insurance status between rapid ART starters and non-rapid starters.
