 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Of the 20 individuals diagnosed with HIV infection in 2016, only two were rapid ART starters. Seventy percent (14/20) of patients were linked to care with a provider within 30 days. In 2017, 26 patients were diagnosed with HIV, 96% (25/26) were linked to care within 30 days, and 35% (9/26) started ART within 7 days. Seventeen patients were diagnosed with HIV in 2018, of which 88% (15/17) were linked to care within 30 days and 29% (5/17) were rapid ART starters. The median time to linkage for the entire sample was 12 days and was significantly shorter for rapid ART starters compared to non-rapid starters (5.5 days vs 15 days; p &lt; 0.001).
