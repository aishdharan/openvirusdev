 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Median time from initial HIV diagnosis to ART start was 5.5 days for rapid ART initiators (vs. 20 days; p &lt; 0.001). The median time from diagnosis to viral suppression decreased from 77 days in non-rapid starters to 55 days in rapid ART starters (p = 0.03). Time from ART start to viral suppression was not statistically different between rapid starters and non-rapid starters (50 vs. 46 days; p = 0.35).
