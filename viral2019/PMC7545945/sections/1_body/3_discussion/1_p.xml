<p id="Par39">Our findings provide evidence of successful implementation and delivery of a rapid ART program in community-based clinic in the Deep South. Acceptance of rapid ART was high and initiation proved to be feasible despite existing structural barriers. Of 63 individuals diagnosed with HIV from 2016 to 2018, only 5 individuals (8%) had an initial CD4+ T cell count &lt; 200 cells/μl, indicating more recent HIV infections than those who may have been diagnosed previously. As a result of this program, individuals who were rapid ART starters achieved faster linkage to care and significant decreases in the time from the initial care visit to ART start as well as the time from initial diagnosis to viral suppression. This is consistent with a review of the literature that includes meta-analyses, prospective, observational and randomized studies.</p>
