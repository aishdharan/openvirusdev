<p id="Par40">To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on the experience of rapid ART initiation in Mississippi. Our evaluation indicates that this demonstration project supports the use of rapid ART as a feasible approach in places that lack local government-mandated and funded initiatives. Rapid ART in this community-based clinic resulted in shorter times to linkage to care with an HIV provider and faster access to ART prescriptions. Rapid ART also serves as a tangible resource for addressing the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative in the U.S.</p>
