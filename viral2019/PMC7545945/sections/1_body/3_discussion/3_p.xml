<p id="Par41">Benefits achieved by rapid ART initiation were first examined in the CASCADE Randomized Clinical Trial conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Viral suppression was achieved by 50.4% of same day starters versus 34.3% in the SOC group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Linkage to care was also higher (68%) for same day starters compared to those in SOC (43.1%). This study supports the use of rapid ART initiation in high-risk patient settings. In an unblinded, randomized trial designed to test and evaluate the use of a rapid service delivery intervention findings suggest that those who benefitted from rapid ART the most were individuals who otherwise would not have initiated care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While time from ART start to virologic suppression between groups in this evaluation was not significant, previous studies support that rapid ART initiation is beneficial to high-risk populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These non-significant findings may be attributed to the unknown period between patients being provided with a prescription for ART and actually starting their medication, due in part by delay caused by third party payers who require a viral load confirmation.
