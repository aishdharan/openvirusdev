<p id="Par42">The success of rapid ART initiation at OAHCC is largely a result of the HIV diagnosis same-day referral partnership between OAHCC and MSDH. Despite the lack of ART starter packs that were provided to patients in previously mentioned demonstration projects, this program was still successful in satisfying ADAP requirements and lessening time from diagnosis to ART start by taking advantage of existing medication assistance programs when needed. The staff is comprised of three part-time physicians, one part-time and one full-time nurse practitioner, three case managers and several nurses dedicated to patient care. In addition, OAHCC is equipped with resources that address micro-barriers such as food insecurity and lack of transportation. Each individual who initiated ART therapy returned for their four week follow-up visit with a provider. This is a testament of the strong social support of OAHCC to maintain retention in care.</p>
