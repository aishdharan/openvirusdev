<p id="Par43">This evaluation has several limitations. Individuals who were classified as rapid ART starters may have had less barriers to care than individuals who were non-rapid starters, resulting in better outcomes for the rapid ART group. OAHCC lacks an on-site pharmacy; therefore, we were unable to verify that patients who received an ART prescription, filled the prescription and started taking antiretrovirals immediately. The ADAP process, which requires that individuals newly diagnosed with HIV be verified through the MSDH HIV reporting system and have initial HIV lab results before medication will be dispensed, contributed to a delay of 2–3 weeks between when the prescription was written and the patient received the medication. Moreover, the number of ART manufacturers that provide immediate access to medications while ADAP is pending is limited.</p>
