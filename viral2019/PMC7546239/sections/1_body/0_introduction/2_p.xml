<p id="d1e447">In December, 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in the Chinese province Hubei. The number of COVID-19 infected cases mainly in China rose dramatically to almost 80,000 at the end of February. From China, COVID-19 quickly spread throughout the whole world, with almost ten million cases at the end of June, 2020. Many countries imposed a nation-wide lockdown to slow down the spread of COVID-19. A reliable forecast of the pandemic outbreak is key for targeted disease countermeasures and for the appropriate design of an exit strategy to lift the lockdown.</p>
