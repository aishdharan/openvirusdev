<p id="d1e623">Throughout this work, we often use “the number of infected cases”, which we understand as “the number of cases 
 <italic>reported</italic> by local authorities”. The asymptomatic individuals, who do not feel sick and even do not know that they are infected and infectious, are not reported and can infect others unnoticed. To gain understanding of the percentage of asymptomatic cases, a possibility is to test the population at random with, for example, a blood test. For COVID-19, the fraction of asymptomatic cases is estimated to be as large as 80% (
