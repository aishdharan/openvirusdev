<p id="d1e3342">The sMAPE error in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> tends to decrease as time evolves, because a growing amount of data is available. Furthermore, the total number of infected cases quickly increases, whereas the daily infected cases increase at a lower rate, indicating sub-exponential growth (

 <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">Prasse, Achterberg and Van Mieghem, 2020</xref>). Sub-exponential growth will inevitably reduce the sMAPE error, because sMAPE is a relative error metric. On the other hand, the prediction accuracy decreases rapidly if the forecast horizon is enlarged. Especially the number of cases for five and six days ahead in time around February 1 cannot be predicted accurately, which is illustrated by
