<p id="d1e3636">The Network Inference-based Prediction Algorithm (NIPA) is a combination of machine learning, phenomenological epidemiology (SIR model) and considers the interaction between different regions. 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">TableÂ 2</xref> illustrates that the prediction accuracy of NIPA is considerably better than any other algorithm. Applying NIPA for each region separately (NIPA separate) yields a forecast error which is comparable to LSTM. We conclude that a network-based approach is beneficial for an accurate forecast. We have also shown that choosing a time-varying or static prior close to the true contact network may improve the forecast accuracy of NIPA. Surprisingly, the inclusion of a time-varying or static prior in NIPA on real infection data is not beneficial for the forecast accuracy for the considered regions. Among several reasons, the chosen prior might be an inaccurate estimate of the true contact network.
