<p>An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become pandemic worldwide. Although most individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit clinical symptoms, a few [1.2% in China (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)] cases do not. Mounting evidence indicates asymptomatic carriers may still be infectious (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Given that asymptomatic cases are not easily identified from the population, they are often neglected by infection prevention and control protocols, and they therefore have a greater potential transmission risk. A better understanding of asymptomatic infections is crucial to prevent and control of this epidemic. Here, we report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of a family cluster with SARS-CoV-2 infection, notably including an 11-month-old infant with persistent fecal viral RNA shedding for 100 days until now (May 13, 2020).
