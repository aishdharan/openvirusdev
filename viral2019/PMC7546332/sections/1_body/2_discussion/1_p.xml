<p>The transmission concealment, symptom subjectivity and detection limitations increase the transmission risk of asymptomatic infections. In this report, case 2 and case 1 appeared symptoms of infection almost at the same time, suggesting that the infection seems to be transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient. To the best of our knowledge, case 4 represents the longest SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA shedding (100 days) in asymptomatic carriers. Although RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests of the nasopharyngeal swab samples have turned negative for nearly 80 days, and the infant's immune system has been boosted for nearly 60 days, her fecal samples have still been SARS-CoV-2 positive.</p>
