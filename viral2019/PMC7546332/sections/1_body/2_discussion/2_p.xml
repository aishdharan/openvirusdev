<p>Currently, case 4 has no respiratory symptoms; considering the negative SARS-CoV-2 of nasopharyngeal swab samples, the viruses might have been eliminated from the respiratory system. Since RNA fragments' half-life is very short (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 viruses, rather than the RNA fragments, still exist, which is supported by the reduced neutrophils and elevated lymphocytes. As fecal samples have been constantly positive, we suspect that the viruses may be present in the gastrointestinal tract. Previous studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor (
