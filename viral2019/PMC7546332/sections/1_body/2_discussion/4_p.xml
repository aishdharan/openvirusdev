<p>The infectivity, transmissibility, and epidemiology of asymptomatic carriers have not been clearly illustrated, and further knowledge is urgently needed. Nevertheless, before thorough understanding, asymptomatic infections still should be managed with caution and vigilance. According to the clinical experience management for asymptomatic carriers, here are some suggestions: (1) pay close attention to asymptomatic infections with intensive monitor and detection; (2) similar to the confirmed COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic carriers should also be isolated and observed until the nucleic acid test turns negative; (3) close contacts of asymptomatic carriers should also be screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection; and (4) for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, besides the normally used nasopharyngeal swab, fecal sample-testing is also needed.</p>
