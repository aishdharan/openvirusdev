<p>None of the national R&amp;D databases provide the complete information of all nationally funded projects. For example, suppose that a five-year nationally funded scientific project was started in June 2015. STAR-METRICS and NTIS contained funding information for some fiscal years, which did not allow us to estimate the total amount of funds for multi-year projects. Thus, calculations were estimated by multiplying the average funding amount per year that was extrapolated based on the title of these projects in the global R&amp;D database and the total period (year) of these projects. After that, we removed some data that included the number of funded projects that were zero and kept some data by adding the organization names as found through manual searches for these projects from other data sources. 
 <xref rid="healthcare-08-00204-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows a total of 273 and 170 nationally funded R&amp;D projects related to coronaviruses utilized for further analysis, respectively.
