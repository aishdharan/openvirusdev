<p>As a way of identifying coronavirus-related R&amp;D areas, the co-occurrence matrix was made in terms of the ASJC code (All Science Journal Classification Codes) of Scopus by using the Vantage Point
 <sup>®</sup> system (Search Technology, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) as demonstrated in [
 <xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. From the single standard’s perspective, the ASJC code was previously assigned to all the projects in the global R&amp;D database that employed the machine learning approach to classify the different R&amp;D projects that stemmed from the US, the EU, and Japan [
 <xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The number of data utilized by Korea, which has the characteristics of the centralized database, was as high as that used by the US. It may cause a “home advantage” bias [
 <xref rid="B26-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, the data of Korea excluded the making of a co-occurrence matrix.
