<p>First, structure–activity relationship modeling-based virus prediction and activity modulation (Sub-Cluster 2-1) included six projects totaling 6,911,261 USD. In the US, The Blood Systems Research Institute joined a 2 million USD project, “Modeling viral entry and its inhibition using SARS-CoV”, between 2007 and 2012. Harvard University worked on a study between 2013 and 2016 entitled “Structure and mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS coronavirus”. In the EU, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven completed a 3.5 million USD project, entitled “Virus discovery and epidemic tracing from high throughput metagenomic sequencing”, between 2015 and 2018. Meanwhile, Osaka University of Japan studied the same research area with expenditures of 144,300 USD between 2016 and 2019 (See
