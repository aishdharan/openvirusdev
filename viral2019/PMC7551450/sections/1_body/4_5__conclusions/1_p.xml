<p>This result has three profound implications for Korea. Firstly, the coronavirus crisis has affected the healthcare systems of Korea locally and has driven many countries around the world to their breaking points, thereby making it clear that the international collaboration of the entire R&amp;D network must remain a priority. Thus, the Korean government must confront the deficiency of their capabilities in core technology areas rather than the “K-quarantine” model, which was emphasized as an asset to support economic cooperation, to pioneer new markets, and to bolster the nation’s reputation in the international community [

Secondly, it is useful for Korea to establish long-term strategies such as international cooperation programs in human resource exchange and bilateral/multilateral R&amp;D activities among the leading organizations. In particular, it is necessary to develop the infectious disease-related basic research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics where Korea’s technology is insufficient. Finally, basic information on the amount of R&amp;D funding and research organizations in leading nations may allow stakeholders in these nations to consider the future directions for establishing R&amp;D investments and policies in the post-corona crisis era. National funding data-based analysis could only provide financial information, which was impossible to deduce when a scientific publication- or patent-based analysis was undertaken.
