<p>As the coronavirus crisis has had devastating impacts on all social and economic sectors around the world, there is a strong need for the adequate global detection and an adequate response to the identification of new variants, including new epidemic variants or new variants with pandemic potential, by enhancing globally collaborative efforts in scientific societies. It is necessary to investigate the status quo of the R&amp;D of global infectious diseases in order to improve global cooperation strategies, with more effective organizational support through funding the R&amp;D of technologies that deal with infectious diseases. Further study is needed on the analysis of R&amp;D funding in virology, recognized as a basic research area for battling against infectious diseases more effectively, and its associated disciplines to strengthen the capacity of global infectious disease surveillance. It may provide useful insights for strategic approaches to an international collaboration network, thereby enhancing the assessment of international cooperative research projects and improving the capacity for a global response to infectious disease threats.</p>
