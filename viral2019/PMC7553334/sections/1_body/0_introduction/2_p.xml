<p>DENV, a single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus, has four serotypes (DEN 1 to 4). Different serotypes can circulate simultaneously during an epidemic with a potential risk of infecting a person as many as four times, once with each serotype. Subsequent infections with different DENV serotypes increase disease severity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dengue infection can be clinically presented with varying severity ranging from asymptomatic infection or self-limiting influenza-like illness to a potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is evidenced that all four serotypes were circulating in Bangladesh during different epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and during the current epidemic re-emergence of DEN-3 serotype was suspected to result in a more severe form of dengue infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
