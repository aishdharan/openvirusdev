All the adult patients (aged more than 18 years) diagnosed as dengue by serological evidence (positive dengue NS1 antigen or IgM antibody) admitted to SZMCH according to the clinical judgment and decision of the physician on duty, and who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The first dengue case of the year was admitted to SZMCH during the first week of June and continued to increase the number of cases up to last week of September. Last patient of our study was included on September 24, and we observed for two more weeks for any new case. As there was no new case during this period, the investigators decided to stop data collection. A total of 319 patients were included in the study.
