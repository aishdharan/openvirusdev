<p>We followed two inclusion criteria such as (i) patients presented with clinical criteria of dengue fever, defined as a history of acute fever with at least two of the following symptoms: headache, retro-orbital or ocular pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, a positive tourniquet test (defined as the presence of â‰¥ 20 petechiae per 1 square inch), or leukopenia (defined as a white blood cell count 5000 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>); and (ii) a confirmed dengue viral infection, defined by positive tests of either specific dengue NS1 antigen if the blood sample was obtained within sixth day of onset of symptoms, or IgM antibody if the blood sample was obtained after sixth day of onset of symptoms using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) from serum samples on admission. Patients with mixed infection (simultaneous infection by other organisms like 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> or chikungunya virus along with dengue virus), or who were pregnant, were excluded from this study.
