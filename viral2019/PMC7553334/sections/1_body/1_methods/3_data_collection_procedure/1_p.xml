<p>Dengue related information including baseline characteristics, clinical parameters, and laboratory findings were recorded from patients in a pre-designed case-report form. Clinical examinations were performed by a physician on admission for each study participant. The NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG antibody detection were done by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) method in the microbiology laboratory of SZMC for the diagnosis of dengue before admission of the patients. DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA Kit and DENV Detect™ IgM/IgG ELISA Kit (InBios International, Inc., USA) were used for detection of dengue NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG respectively. Other laboratory investigations including complete blood count (using Sysmex XN-2000™ Hematology Autoanalyzer, Sysmex Corporation), serum ALT, AST, and creatinine were performed on patient admission and complete blood count was repeated every day to track hematocrit and platelet count changes. The severity of dengue was categorized on the date of discharge according to the WHO’s 2009 classification as non-severe and severe dengue [
