<p>Non-severe dengue without warning signs was defined as having acute fever with at least two of the following criteria: headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, rash, a positive tourniquet test, or leukopenia. Warning signs included: abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting (vomiting with signs of dehydration), clinical fluid accumulation, bleeding from mucosal areas including nose, gums, gastrointestinal tract or vagina, lethargy, restlessness, liver enlargement &gt;2 cm, increase in hematocrit (≥20%) concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count (≤100000/μL). Severe dengue was defined as having (i) severe plasma leakage, defined as plasma leakage with shock or respiratory distress (respiratory rate ≥24 breaths/min with oxygen saturation &lt;95% in room air and/or requiring oxygen therapy), (ii) severe clinical bleeding, defined as spontaneous bleeding from mucosal areas that necessitates a blood transfusion, or (iii) severe organ involvement, defined as AST &gt;1000 IU/L and/or ALT &gt;1000 IU/L, serum creatinine ≥2 times above baseline, myocarditis, and/or encephalitis [

Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, raised hematocrit, raised ALT, raised AST and raised creatinine were defined as a platelet count of 100,000 platelets/μL or less, white blood cell count 5000 cells/μL, as &gt;48% or ≥20% increase than baseline, as &gt;42 IU/L, as &gt;37 IU/L and as &gt;1.2 mg/dl respectively [
