<p>All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (IBM version 22.0). Clinical and laboratory parameters among different groups were compared with the chi-square test or Fisherâ€™s exact tests, as appropriate in case of numerical variable and t-test or ANOVA, as appropriate in case of continuous variables. For the case of t-test and ANOVA, we checked the standard assumptions of t-test and ANOVA. All tests were interpreted with p &lt; 0.05 indicating statistical significance.</p>
