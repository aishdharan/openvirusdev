<p>The dengue epidemic has become a major public health threat for many South-East Asian endemic countries. A number of outbreaks of dengue occurred in Bangladesh, mostly affecting Dhaka, the capital city and the central region. Though the exact cause is unknown, it is likely that increased air connectivity with the dengue-prevalent South Asian countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the climate change, unplanned urbanization and construction works, high density of population, and incapable health care system [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], humid weather, availability of source of mosquito breeding (stagnant clean water, especially during and just after the rainy season) poor drainage system, poor mosquito control measures, and unconsciousness of the city dwellers could have contributed to the epidemics in the city. A nationwide sero-prevalence study reported much lower prevalence in the northern region of the country compared to the central region and most of these cases were suspected to be referred from endemic zones [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite the fact, during the 2019 epidemic a huge number of cases were reported from this region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and travel history to endemic zone was not a significant risk factor of dengue infection of these patients, as our study found. It is a matter of concern that dengue is not confined to the reported endemic zone of the country; rather it has become a national health emergency.
