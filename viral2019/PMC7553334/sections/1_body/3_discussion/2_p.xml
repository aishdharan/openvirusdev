<p>Appropriate clinical management of the huge number of patients during an epidemic is a great challenge for a poor-resource country like Bangladesh. To address the issue WHO revised the previous classification system and introduced a newer version in 2009 with an intention of more convenient management based on clinical and laboratory parameters. Despite the fact, the implication of this classification resulted in a higher number of hospital admissions of dengue fever increasing the burden on vulnerable health care system [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is important to identify the patients who are potentially at risk of developing severe disease and need more intensive monitoring by clinical and primary laboratory evaluation. It was necessary to explore these parameters in the context of Bangladeshi patients as there is hardly any evidence of clinical, hematological and biochemical profile of dengue patients based on the updated case definition. The present study was aimed at meeting the knowledge gap which would help to improve the predictive and diagnostic process of dengue.
