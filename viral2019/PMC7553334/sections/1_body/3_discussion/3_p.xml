<p>Clinical manifestations and laboratory profiles of our dengue patient cohort were quite similar to the patients of previous dengue epidemics in Bangladesh [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Fever, headache, and myalgia were the most common clinical presentations of our patients. In hematological evaluation, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and raised hematocrit level were the most frequent findings. Petechiae or skin rash was the commonest bleeding manifestation among the present cohort as evidenced in previous studies conducted in the endemic area [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], though the prevalence was much lower here. However, severe dengue was mainly manifested as severe plasma leakage and severe organ involvement in our study population rather than dengue hemorrhagic fever, which was more prevalent in previous epidemics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Severe plasma leakage was also a more common manifestation of severe dengue during a recent epidemic in Singapore [
