<p>Most of the patients of the present study were suffering from primary dengue while the ratio of primary and secondary dengue was almost equal in previous epidemics that occurred in Dhaka city [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The sero-prevalence of dengue was reported as much lower in our study region compared to Dhaka city [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Perhaps this phenomenon has limited the number of severe dengue, as we found, most of the dengue cases of our study were non-severe. Moreover, assumed re-emergence of DEN-3 serotype, which causes more severe disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], is also questionable in context of this region, as number of severe cases was low. However, detailed demography, clinical presentation and causative serotype of DENV of the 2019 epidemic in the endemic zone are not reported yet, so we could not compare our findings. Secondary infection was more likely to be associated with severe dengue among our study population, consistent with findings of other studies [
