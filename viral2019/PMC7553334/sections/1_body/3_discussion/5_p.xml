<p>Fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, and other constitutional symptoms were associated with non-severe dengue. The basic pathophysiological explanation of this finding is that these non-specific symptoms of viral febrile illness are mostly found in the febrile phase of dengue, whereas severe dengue is usually manifested during the critical phase when there is increased risk of plasma leakage and shock [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008567.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For this phenomenon, patients, who were admitted during the critical phase of the disease course developed severe dengue more frequently according to our finding, as also evidenced in a previous study [
