<p>Among hematological parameters, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common findings on admission though there was no significant difference in these parameters between severe and non-severe dengue patients. However, rise in hematocrit by more than 20% during hospital stay was associated with severe dengue in our patient cohort, which is similar to previous findings, though thrombocytopenia was also reported as a predictor of severe dengue in these studies [

Most of the patients’ suffering from severe dengue of our study cohort presented as severe plasma leakage rather than severe hemorrhage, so thrombocytopenia was not significantly associated with severe dengue. Our result suggests that severe organ involvement can be predicted from early rise of biomarkers, especially serum ALT in case of liver involvement and serum creatinine in case of renal involvement. Similar results were reported by others [
