<p>According to our findings, almost half of the admitted dengue patients in SZMCH had no warning sign which could have made them vulnerable for developing severe dengue, as defined by the WHO. There is a justifiable space for argument whether admitting these patients was appropriate or not. As our study and previous ones suggested, warning signs like abdominal pain, hepatomegaly as well as persistent vomiting were more likely associated with developing severe disease, these clinical features should be taken into account when screening a dengue patient for admission, especially in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh. Moreover, increasing hematocrit (&gt;20%) during hospital stay, raised liver enzyme and serum creatinine beyond upper margin of normal value were associated with severe dengue. So, screening patients with these laboratory parameters on first visit with periodic follow up keeping them on outdoor management may reduce the hospital burden of those admitted patients for whom outdoor management was potentially enough.</p>
