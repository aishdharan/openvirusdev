<p>Although the present study was the first attempt to report dengue patient profile from a non-endemic region of the country, it has some limitations: (i) patients were recruited from a specific geographic territory, which is not in the dengue-endemic zone of the country. So our data may not be representative of dengue patients of the whole country; (ii) only hospitalized patients in the study center (SZMCH) were included in this study and as a result, a number of non-severe dengue patients, who were managed in outpatient settings and those who were treated in other facilities as well as did not visit hospital due to mildness of symptoms or other causes were missed, so the patients included in this study do not represent all the patients with dengue in this region; (iii) we confirmed dengue based on serological test, RT-PCR to detect viral RNA and serotyping of DENV was not done; (iv) hydration and volume expansion could have had an effect on hematocrit that could potentially bias the data. Regardless of the depicted limitations, the present study ultimately provides the baseline data on clinical, hematological and biochemical profiles of dengue patients of the respective region of the country as well as generate evidence of clinical and laboratory parameters to predict the development of severe dengue.</p>
