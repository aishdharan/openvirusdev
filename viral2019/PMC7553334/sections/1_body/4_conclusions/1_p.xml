<p>Management and prognosis of dengue are mostly based on clinical presentations as well as laboratory findings like hematological and biochemical parameters. The present study reported that fever, headache, and myalgia were the commonest presenting complaints of dengue patients whereas vomiting and abdominal pain was the most prevalent warning signs. Severe dengue was associated mostly with plasma leakage rather than hemorrhage and the rise of hematocrit during hospital stay was a predictor of severe dengue. We hope and believe that these findings will guide physicians for prompt therapeutic management of dengue infection in the study area.</p>
