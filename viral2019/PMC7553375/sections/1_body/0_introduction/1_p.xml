<p id="Par12">A novel coronavirus, named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in 2019 in China. The disease caused by the highly contagious virus is called the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It spread over the world in a couple of months, causing high fatality and enormous burden on the health care providers. The identification of the infected patients has a high importance to control the disease. However the clinical picture might not be helpful, since a large majority of patients are asymptomatic or having only mild symptoms. Even if the patient had symptoms, those are rather unspecific (fever, cough, dyspnea). Consequently, the performance of various diagnostic tools such as molecular biological tests and imaging are in the focus of the current scientific interest. To date, one of the biggest questions is where chest CT stands in the screening and diagnostic process in comparison with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. In this paper, we try to summarize the results available so far in this topic. We evaluate the available data on the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of chest CT.</p>
