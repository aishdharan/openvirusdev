<p id="Par26">It was shown in a recent manuscript (submitted, not accepted at the time of the drafting of this manuscript) that the performance of the RT-PCR from various respiratory specimens is modest. During the first 2 weeks after symptom onset, 74–88% of sputum samples are positive and only 53–73% of the nasal swabs. Consequently, one might ask if RT-PCR can be considered as a gold standard. In the following section, we will re-evaluate the abovementioned studies as if the chest CT with typical clinical presentation was the reference (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This approach certainly underestimates the sensitivity of RT-PCR and overestimates the specificity of chest CT because of not considering other diseases having very similar clinical and CT presentation. However, the traditional estimation considering the RT-PCR as a gold standard (see previous chapter) might suffer from not considering the modest sensitivity of the RT-PCR.
