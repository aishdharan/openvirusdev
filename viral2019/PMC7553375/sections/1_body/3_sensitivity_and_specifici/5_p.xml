<p id="Par30">The collaboration of radiologists from Changsha (Hunan province of China) and Province, RI, USA, is providing a picture probably closer to the truth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The authors collected chest CTs from 219 COVID-19 patients from China and 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel for viral pneumonia from Province, RI, from a time period between 2017 and 2019 when no COVID-19 was reported in the USA. The sensitivity for COVID-19 of the Chinese radiologists ranged from 72 to 94%, the specificity 24 to 94%, and the accuracy 60 to 83%. In a smaller subsample of patients, US radiologists had sensitivity of 70 to 93%, specificity of 93 to 100%, and accuracy of 84 to 97%.
