<p id="Par31">Fang’s report from Eastern China showed that the sensitivity of the RT-PCR might not be optimal at the beginning of the disease. The first RT-PCR test performed in the first 3 (± 3) days after symptom onset was positive in only 36 of the 51 patients. Further 12 patients had positive RT-PCR test on the second occasion (24–48 h after the first), 2 patients by three tests (2–5 days), and one patient by four tests (7 days). On the other hand, 98% of the patients had positive chest CT scan on the first occasion (36 patients with typical and 14 with atypical CT manifestations) [

Repeated RT-PCR test 48–72 h later identified further 3 patients and retest for the third time (5–8 days after the first) identified 3 patients. Importantly, the initial CT scan was positive in all but one patient. Therefore, the sensitivity of chest CT at the initial presentation was 97.2% and the RT-PCR only 84.6%. The importance of multiple RT-PCR tests were emphasized by Xie too [
