Compared with those COVID-19 patients in the epidemic area Wuhan city, the proportions of patients with severe/critical clinical status and patients who needed ICU care or mechanical ventilation in this study were relatively lower [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This is mainly because Guangzhou can screen all suspected patients and has enough medical resources to ensure that all confirmed COVID-19 patients can be admitted to the designated hospital as soon as possible.</p><p id="par0110">SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected not only in respiratory tract, but also in blood, digestive tract and feces [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>].

Recently published research showed that SARS-COV-2 RNA in serum was associated with multiple organ damages and higher mortality rate [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our previous cross-sectional study indicated that detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood was an indicator for the further clinical severity, another study showed that detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the digestive tract was a potential warning indicator of severe disease [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this larger sample size longitudinal study, we found patients with detectable extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 RNA had an approximately 18-fold increase in the risk of respiratory failure and a 19-fold increase in the risk of ICU admission. In addition, patients with extrapulmonary virus had higher chance of progression from mild/moderate to severe/critical status (22.6 % vs. 8.7 %, P = 0.003). More importantly, we found the double positive patients (anal swabs positive plus blood samples positive) had much more severe disease (5/6 patients were severe/critical cases), highlighting the need to perform routine examination of digestive tract and blood virus in the clinic.</p><p id="par0115">Lymphocytopenia is often found in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe ones [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Notably, higher CD4/CD8 ratio was independently associate with higher risk of respiratory failure and ICU admission. This result indicated that lymphocyte subsets could be a useful parameter for early prediction of prognosis of COVID-19. We also found that there was no significant change in the percentage of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the convalescent phase of COVID-19 compared to the baseline, so further research is needed to explore the repair process of the immune system.</p><p id="par0120">The underlying mechanism between extrapulmonary distribution of the virus and CD4/CD8 ratio and disease severity is not completely clear. It could be explained by the following reasons. First, the extrapulmonary distribution of the virus may reflect the rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus, which break through the alveolar vessel, leakage into the blood flow and spread throughout the body [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further analysis showed that the cycle threshold (Ct) values (Ct = ORF1ab + N) of the throat swabs were lower in patients with extrapulmonary virus than those without (median: Ct = 36 + 34.5 vs. Ct = 40 + 39), suggesting a higher viral load in extrapulmonary virus positive patients. Second, counts of lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset are of great value to ensure immune system functionality, so the decreased lymphocyte, especially CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, might reflect immune injuries caused by virus attachment and/or inflammatory mediators. Third, the strong viral damage and the weakened immune system would make it difficult to eliminate the virus. We found that the duration from admission to positive-to-negative conversion of throat swabs viral RNA was longer in patients with extrapulmonary virus (11 days vs. 8 days, P = 0.032), despite they have similar antiviral treatment strategy. The persistence of the virus and the prolonged course of the disease may also be one of the reasons for the aggravation of the disease.</p><p id="par0125">In this study, around 75 % of mild/moderate patients and nearly 100 % of the severe/critical patients received antiviral treatment including Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), abidol and chloroquine. However, these antiviral regimens perform little benefit for improving the clinical outcomes including virus clearance of hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 beyond supportive treatment [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. The median days from admission to positive-to-negative conversion of viral RNA exceeded 10 days (11 days [IQR, 8-17]) in severe/critical cases disregard LPV/r or abidol or chloroquine, which indicates the antiviral failure of these medicines. Even so, our study in another way implies that comprehensive therapy scheme could successfully prevent and treat COVID-19 even without effective antiviral regimens currently.</p><p id="par0130">Our study has some limitations. First, the comparison of different antiviral regimens was not randomized nor blinded, the baseline health status between antiviral and non-antiviral patients were not comparable. Second, we did not collect information on absolute values of T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes and dendritic cells. In addition, we were unable to provide information on the changes in the absolute number of immune cells in these patients. Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between these immunological indexes and outcomes of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="sec0070"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="par0135">In summary, most of COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou are in mild/moderate clinical status, and comprehensive therapy scheme could successfully treat COVID-19 even without effective antiviral regimens currently.
