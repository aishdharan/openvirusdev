<p id="par0075">A total of 270 patients were detected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs and/or blood samples, and the overall positive rate was 23.0 % (62/270), higher in severe/critical cases than in mild/moderate cases (52.0 % vs. 16.4 %, P &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). 217 patients were detected for viral RNA in anal swabs at a median of 8 days (QIR, 4-19) after admission, of which 21.2 % (46/217) were positive. The proportions of anal swabs positive were 27.9 % in severe/critical cases and 19.5 % in mild/moderate cases, but the difference is not statistically significant (P = 0.229). 234 patients were detected for viral RNA in blood samples at a median of 5 days (QIR, 2-8) after admission, and 9.4 % (22/234) were positive. The proportions of blood samples positive were significantly higher in severe/critical cases than in mild/moderate cases (43.2 % vs. 1.6 %, P &lt; 0.001). 181 patients were detected for viral RNA both in anal swabs and blood samples, and 6 (3.3 %) patients were double positive (all were male, age ranged from 30 to 82 years). Notably, three of the six double positive patients were critical cases who developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU), two patients were severe cases who need high-flow nasal cannula and close monitoring, only one patient was moderate case.
