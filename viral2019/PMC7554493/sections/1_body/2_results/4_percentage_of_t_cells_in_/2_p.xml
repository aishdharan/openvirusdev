<p id="par0080">286 of the 297 patients (96.3 %) were analyzed for the percentage of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD4/CD8 ratio by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). Compared to the mild/moderate cases, the severe/critical cases had lower percentage of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (52.6 % vs. 61.4 %, P &lt; 0.001) and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (33.2 % vs. 36.5 %, P = 0.034), but higher percentage of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (62.8 % vs. 55.8 %, P = 0.016) (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). The CD4/CD8 ratio on admission was significantly higher in severe/critical cases than in mild/moderate cases (1.84 vs. 1.50, P = 0.022). In addition, patients who were detectable for viral RNA in blood samples had lower percentage of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (42.1 % vs. 61.2 %, P &lt; 0.001) and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (26.4 % vs. 33.6 %, P = 0.013), but higher percentage of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (66.9 % vs. 56.2 %, P = 0.010) (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), and higher CD4/CD8 ratio (2.57 vs. 1.49, P = 0.008). However, there was no significant difference in the percentage of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells between admission and the end of follow up (60.0 % vs. 60.1 %; 57.3 % vs. 57.2 %; 35.4 % vs. 34.3 %; all P values&gt;0.05).
