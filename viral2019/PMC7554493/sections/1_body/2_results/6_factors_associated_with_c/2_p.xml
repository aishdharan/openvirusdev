<p id="par0100">Cox regression model was performed to analyze the association of baseline parameters including age, gender, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory index, imaging findings and extrapulmonary virological detection with the probability of respiratory failure (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). In the multivariate analysis, detectable viral RNA in anal swabs and/or blood samples (HR: 17.91, 95 % CI: 3.90–82.20, P &lt; 0.001), CD4/CD8 ratio (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, 95 % CI: 1.07–1.44, P = 0.005) and dyspnea (HR: 3.97, 95 % CI: 1.34–11.79, P = 0.013) were independently associated with respiratory failure. We further analyzed factors associated with ICU admission, and found that detectable viral RNA in anal swabs and/or blood samples (HR: 18.95, 95 % CI: 5.59–64.27, P &lt; 0.001), and CD4/CD8 ratio (HR: 1.25, 95 % CI: 1.00–1.56, P = 0.046) were also independent predictors (Supplemental Table 2).
