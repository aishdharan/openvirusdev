 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recently published research showed that SARS-COV-2 RNA in serum was associated with multiple organ damages and higher mortality rate [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our previous cross-sectional study indicated that detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood was an indicator for the further clinical severity, another study showed that detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the digestive tract was a potential warning indicator of severe disease [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this larger sample size longitudinal study, we found patients with detectable extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 RNA had an approximately 18-fold increase in the risk of respiratory failure and a 19-fold increase in the risk of ICU admission. In addition, patients with extrapulmonary virus had higher chance of progression from mild/moderate to severe/critical status (22.6 % vs. 8.7 %, P = 0.003). More importantly, we found the double positive patients (anal swabs positive plus blood samples positive) had much more severe disease (5/6 patients were severe/critical cases), highlighting the need to perform routine examination of digestive tract and blood virus in the clinic.
