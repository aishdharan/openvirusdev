<p id="par0115">Lymphocytopenia is often found in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe ones [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Chen et al. found lower CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells count was associated with ICU admission [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Liu et al. found the more serious the disease and the worse the prognosis, the lower were the T cell, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell, and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts on admission [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A recent published study found CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher in critically ill than in non-critically ill patients [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We found severe/critical patients had lower levels of lymphocytes, lower percentage of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells but higher percentage of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells than mild/moderate ones. Notably, higher CD4/CD8 ratio was independently associate with higher risk of respiratory failure and ICU admission. This result indicated that lymphocyte subsets could be a useful parameter for early prediction of prognosis of COVID-19. We also found that there was no significant change in the percentage of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the convalescent phase of COVID-19 compared to the baseline, so further research is needed to explore the repair process of the immune system.
