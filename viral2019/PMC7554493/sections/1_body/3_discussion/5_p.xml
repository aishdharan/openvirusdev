<p id="par0120">The underlying mechanism between extrapulmonary distribution of the virus and CD4/CD8 ratio and disease severity is not completely clear. It could be explained by the following reasons. First, the extrapulmonary distribution of the virus may reflect the rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus, which break through the alveolar vessel, leakage into the blood flow and spread throughout the body [

Further analysis showed that the cycle threshold (Ct) values (Ct = ORF1ab + N) of the throat swabs were lower in patients with extrapulmonary virus than those without (median: Ct = 36 + 34.5 vs. Ct = 40 + 39), suggesting a higher viral load in extrapulmonary virus positive patients. Second, counts of lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset are of great value to ensure immune system functionality, so the decreased lymphocyte, especially CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, might reflect immune injuries caused by virus attachment and/or inflammatory mediators. Third, the strong viral damage and the weakened immune system would make it difficult to eliminate the virus. We found that the duration from admission to positive-to-negative conversion of throat swabs viral RNA was longer in patients with extrapulmonary virus (11 days vs. 8 days, P = 0.032), despite they have similar antiviral treatment strategy. The persistence of the virus and the prolonged course of the disease may also be one of the reasons for the aggravation of the disease.
