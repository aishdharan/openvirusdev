<p id="par0125">In this study, around 75 % of mild/moderate patients and nearly 100 % of the severe/critical patients received antiviral treatment including Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), abidol and chloroquine. However, these antiviral regimens perform little benefit for improving the clinical outcomes including virus clearance of hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 beyond supportive treatment [

The median days from admission to positive-to-negative conversion of viral RNA exceeded 10 days (11 days [IQR, 8-17]) in severe/critical cases disregard LPV/r or abidol or chloroquine, which indicates the antiviral failure of these medicines. Even so, our study in another way implies that comprehensive therapy scheme could successfully prevent and treat COVID-19 even without effective antiviral regimens currently.
