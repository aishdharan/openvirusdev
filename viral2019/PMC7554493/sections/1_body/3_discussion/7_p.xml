<p id="par0130">Our study has some limitations. First, the comparison of different antiviral regimens was not randomized nor blinded, the baseline health status between antiviral and non-antiviral patients were not comparable. Second, we did not collect information on absolute values of T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes and dendritic cells. In addition, we were unable to provide information on the changes in the absolute number of immune cells in these patients. Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between these immunological indexes and outcomes of COVID-19.</p>
