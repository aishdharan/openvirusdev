These were two tourists from Italy (ages 68 and 70), and a 71-year-old Puerto Rican with lymphoma and diabetes, whose relatives had recently traveled to Chicago, Illinois. Within the past 30 months Puerto Rico had experienced several major natural disasters, including hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017 with widespread interruption of the infrastructure for essential services.

The curfew, and its strict enforcement, were extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. The curfew was accompanied by NPI mitigation measures which focused on identifying and isolating index COVID-19 cases and recommending a 14-day quarantine of contacts, in accordance with CDC guidelines. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in the island.
