<p>All molecular diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection (and COVID-19 case detection) were conducted using eight available FDA Emergency Use Authority (EUA)-approved real-time polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) test kits: 1) CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (CDC); 2) Roche’s SARS-CoV-2Test; 3) LabCorp 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Test; 4) Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR; 5) Panther Fusion SARS-COV-2 Assay; 6) Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2; 7) Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2; and 8) ID NOW COVID-19. These diagnostic tests were conducted in approximately 900 laboratories throughout the island and processed by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) Public Health Laboratory and five private reference laboratories, three (3) in Puerto Rico and two (2) in the United States. Test results were initially reported to the PRDH through an email address (
 <email>labresult@salud.pr.gov</email>), and later through a centralized electronic platform (BioPortal). From March 15 through May 15, 2020 results were reported to the PRDH, following CDC guidelines for COVID-19 case definitions both for cases and deaths [
 <xref rid="pone.0240013.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. All positive RT-PCR test results were de-duplicated to account for individuals who had more than one clinical specimen submitted for testing, and to accurately derive the number of individual COVID-19 cases over time (by date of sample collection). A de-identified public use time series database was used for analyses, and the project proposal was evaluated by the Human Research Subject Protection Office (HRSPO) at University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. A determination was made, and documentation provided, by HRSPO that this type of secondary data analysis does not meet the federal regulations that define research with human subjects.
