<p>Using the epidemic curve, we compared the pre- and post- estimates of the epidemic growth rate (r) and its corresponding reproductive number (R) by March 30, two weeks after the mandatory curfew was implemented. Deaths were included for analysis through May 31 to account for the censoring effect in the registration of recent deaths. Given the 12-day phase shift between the two curves, a cohort approach for the estimation of the case fatality risk was adopted. As case and death records could not be individually linked (because COVID-19 deaths without confirmatory laboratory test were included, consistent with the CDC definition), the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases was considered the population at risk to estimate the case fatality risk of COVID-19 associated deaths through May 31.</p>
