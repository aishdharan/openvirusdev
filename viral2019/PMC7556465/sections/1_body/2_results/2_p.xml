<p>The number of daily RT-PCR confirmed cases peaked on March 30, showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240013.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Private laboratories close on weekends, leaving the PRDH Public Health Laboratory as the only lab serving the country; testing is reserved for symptomatic patients needing urgent care. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 15.87% (95% CI: 7.59%, 24.15%), corresponding to R of 1.82 (95% CI:1.37, 2.30). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -2.95% (95% CI: -4.99%, -0.92%), corresponding to R of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.98). Throughout the observation period, the total number of RT-PCR tests per day fluctuated but trended to a lower proportion of positive results (from 15.2% in the first two weeks to 0.3% in the last two weeks of the study period).
