<p>The epidemic curve e of total confirmed COVID-19 cases through May 15, with its peak of 85 cases on March 30 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240013.g003">Fig 3</xref>), when laid over the distribution of deaths through May 31, with its peak around April 12 (6 deaths), shows a clear 12-day shift consistent with the expected delay between infection and death. Therefore, the case fatality risk can be estimated as 10.9% (143/1311), given that the population at risk for a COVID-19 related death would correspond to the COVID-19 cases included in the epidemic curve.
