<p>Using the Gompertz model, the estimated growth in COVID-19 cases would have reached a total of 7,466 by May 15, compared with the 1,311 observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240013.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Similarly, the Gompertz model estimates 354 COVID-19 deaths by June 1, compared with 143 observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240013.g005">Fig 5</xref>), for a total 6,155 COVID-19 cases and 211 deaths averted during the observation period. Given the relatively small number of observations, the predictive intervals are too wide to be meaningful.
