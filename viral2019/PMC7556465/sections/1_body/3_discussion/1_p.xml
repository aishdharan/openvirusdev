<p>Our findings are consistent with the use of NPIs as very effective early COVID-19 mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. It is likely that detection of COVID-19 cases remains under ascertained on the island, as suggested by the relatively high crude estimate of the case fatality risk of approximately 10%. However, this under ascertainment should not alter the estimates obtained from the epidemic curve provided the COVID-19 case ascertainment remained relatively constant throughout the study period. The observed decreasing trend in the proportion of RT-PCR positive tests lend support to this assumption. Furthermore, the mortality curve is consistent with a 2-week delay relative to the epidemic curve of the COVID-19 cases, as well as with hospital data reported elsewhere [
