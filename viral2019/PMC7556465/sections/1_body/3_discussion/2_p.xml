<p>We relied on relatively conservative Gompertz modelling to derive counterfactual estimates of the expected number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Public health actions contributed to an estimated 6,155 averted COVID-19 cases and 211 averted deaths by May 31. These results show benefits associated with the early implementation of NPIs for COVID-19, with stay-at home orders, accompanied by mandated curfew and closure of non-essential services in a manner consistent with historical reports of benefits observed with similar use of NPIS in various U.S. cities during the 1918â€“1919 influenza pandemic [

In addition, these data serve as a baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to containment stages in Puerto Rico. We recommend that RT-PCR testing capacity to readily identify COVID-19 cases remain available for all symptomatic individuals in Puerto Rico, as well as for all essential workers, and that the public health infrastructure for case investigation and contact identification and tracing, accompanied by targeted isolation and quarantine, continue to be strengthened and scaled up to safeguard the gains observed to date.
