 <p>After Algeria and Morocco, the mosquito 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was detected in 2018 in Tunisia. This invasive species has continued its global expansion and then, extended the fear of introducing 
  <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted arboviral diseases in countries where people are immunologically na√Øve. We demonstrated, using experimental infections, that 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes from Tunisia were more competent to chikungunya virus than to Zika virus and dengue virus. These results are critical to design a control strategy targeting 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> populations in regions hosting travelers returning from arboviral-endemic regions.
