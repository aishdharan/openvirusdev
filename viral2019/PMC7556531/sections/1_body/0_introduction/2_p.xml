<p>This species was responsible for serious outbreaks of arboviral diseases since it is a competent vector for at least 26 arboviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Europe, the species has been involved in local transmission of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], dengue virus (DENV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and more recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among all arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes, DENV (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) causes the highest incidence in terms of human morbidity and mortality, with 300 million people infected each year resulting in 22,000 deaths [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Historically, four serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) have been described within the DENV antigenic complex [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Besides, CHIKV (
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) is an arthritogenic virus composed of three major genotypic lineages: Asian, East/Central/South African (ECSA), and West African [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CHIKV was responsible for a large-scale epidemic within the Indian Ocean region in 2004–5 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] where the principal vector was 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, instead of the more traditional 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The shift in vector species was associated with a single alanine to valine substitution at position 226 of the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The ECSA strain was responsible for millions cases in Asia, Africa, and Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Lastly, ZIKV (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) hit recently billions of immunologically naïve people in regions where ZIKV-competent mosquitoes predominate. After the South Pacific region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], ZIKV reached the American continent in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] where ZIKV of the Asian clade circulated [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The mosquito 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> seems to be the main vector of ZIKV and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, a secondary vector [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
