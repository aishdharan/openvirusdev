<p>The effect of virus on IR, DR and TR was investigated using logistic regression models, as were investigated the effects of dpi and of viral load. Viral loads were compared between groups using Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. Then, viral load measured in abdomen that best discriminated i) mosquitoes that disseminated from those that did not and ii) mosquitoes that transmitted from those that did not, was investigated using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves which are graphical plots that represent the ability of a continuous marker to correctly classify a binary outcome. Viral load measured in head/thorax that best discriminated mosquitoes that transmitted from those that did not, was also investigated using ROC curves. Based on the ROC curves, thresholds that best discriminated mosquitoes with and without dissemination on the one hand, and with and without transmission in the other hand were identified. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Stata software (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA). p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>
