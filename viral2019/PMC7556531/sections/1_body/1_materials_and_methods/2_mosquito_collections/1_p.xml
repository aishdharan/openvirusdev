After egg hatching, 200 larvae were distributed in pans containing 1 liter of dechlorinated water and a yeast tablet renewed every 2 days, and maintained at 25±1°C. Pupae were individually collected in bowls placed in cages where adults emerged. Adults were fed with a 10% sucrose solution and kept at 28±1°C with a 16L:8D cycle and 80% relative humidity.
