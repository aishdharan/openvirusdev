<p>Five to six batches of 60 females (7–10 day old) were isolated in boxes and exposed to an infectious blood meal containing 1.4 mL of washed rabbit erythrocytes, 700 μL of viral suspension and ATP at 1 mM as a phagostimulant. The titer of the blood meal was at 10
 <sup>7</sup> focus-forming unit (ffu)/mL for CHIKV and DENV, and 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL for ZIKV. The feeding procedure used a Hemotek system with a pork intestine as membrane covering the base of a feeder maintained at 37°C. After 15 min of feeding, engorged mosquitoes were transferred in cardboard containers and maintained with 10% sucrose under controlled conditions (28±1°C, relative humidity of 80%, 16L:8D cycle) for up to 21 days.
