<p>Surviving mosquitoes at each examined dpi, were cold anesthetized on ice. Then legs and wings were removed and the proboscis was inserted into a pipette tip containing 5 μL of fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 30 min, the tip content was transferred in 45 μL of L15 medium [

These two samples were separately ground in 300 μL of Leibovitz L15 medium (Invitrogen, CA, USA) supplemented with 2% FBS, and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5 min at +4°C. Abdomen (containing the midgut), head/thorax (if viruses are detected, it means that head/thorax contains viruses having escaped from the midgut) were tested respectively for infection and dissemination while saliva was titrated to estimate transmission.
