<p>To measure the vector competence, three indices were evaluated at the two main steps in the path of the virus inside mosquitoes after the infectious blood meal: (i) infection rate (IR) corresponding to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected midgut among engorged mosquitoes, (ii) dissemination rate (DR) referring to the proportion of mosquitoes having succeeded in disseminating the virus inside the mosquito general cavity (namely the hemocele) among mosquitoes with infected midgut, and (iii) transmission rate (TR) which measures the final step corresponding to the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among mosquitoes having disseminated the virus. DR measures the efficiency of the midgut as a barrier to the dissemination of the virus inside the hemocele; the higher it is, the less the midgut is a brake to the dissemination of the virus. In addition to DR, TR measures the efficiency of the salivary glands as a barrier to the excretion of the virus in the saliva; as DR, the higher it is, the less the salivary glands play the role of barrier to the transmission of the virus.</p>
