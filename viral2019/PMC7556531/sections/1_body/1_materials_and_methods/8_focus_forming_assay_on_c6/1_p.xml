 <italic>albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. After serial dilutions, samples were inoculated onto C6/36 cells in 96-well plates. After a 3-day incubation period for CHIKV, and 5-day for DENV at 28Â°C, cells were stained using hyper-immune ascetic fluid specific to each virus as the primary antibody: provided by the French National Reference Center for Arbovirus at the Institut Pasteur for CHIKV and Ms X Dengue complex MAB 8705 (Millipore, MA, USA) for DENV. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, CA, USA) was used as the secondary antibody.
