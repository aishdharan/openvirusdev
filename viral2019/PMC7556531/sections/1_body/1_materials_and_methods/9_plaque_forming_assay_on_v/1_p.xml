<p>For ZIKV, homogenates were serially diluted and inoculated onto monolayers of Vero cells in 96-well plates. After a 7-day incubation period at 37Â°C, cells were stained with a solution of safranine (0.5% in 10% formaldehyde and 10% ethanol). Presence of viral particles was assessed by CPE detection. Saliva was titrated on monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well plates incubated 7 days under an agarose overlay.</p>
