<p>A total of 357 mosquitoes were exposed to an infectious blood meal and 54.6% (195/357) were abdomen-infected: 81.3% (109/134) for CHIKV, 26.2% (37/141) for DENV and 59.8% (49/82) for ZIKV. The logistic regression model also showed the significantly reduced IR with ZIKV and even further with DENV (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; P &lt; 0.001). Out of the 195 infected mosquitoes, dissemination occurred in 139 (71.7%), with DR of 90.8% with CHIKV, 48.6% with DENV and 44.9% with ZIKV. Again, the logistic regression showed a significantly reduced DR with DENV and ZIKV (P &lt; 0.001). Finally, out of the 139 mosquitoes with dissemination, transmission was observed in 53 (38.1%), TR being 45.4% with CHIKV, 17.6% with DENV and 22.7% with ZIKV; as compared to TR with CHIKV, it was significantly reduced with DENV and only tended to be lower with ZIKV. The univariate logistic regression showed no effect of dpi on IR, but a potential effect on DR and on TR (
