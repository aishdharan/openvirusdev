<p>With CHIKV specifically, IR ranged from 76.7% (3 dpi) to 79.2% (21 dpi) and among mosquitoes with an infected midgut, more than 80% (DR from 82.6% at 3 dpi to 94.7% at 21 dpi) were able to disseminate the virus from the midgut epithelium into the hemocele (i.e. efficient crossing of the midgut barrier) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Among mosquitoes with disseminated infection, at least 26.3% (3 dpi) were able to transmit the virus expelled with mosquito saliva (i.e. efficient crossing of the salivary glands barrier); a TR of 75% were detected at 10 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). More globally, when considering mosquitoes with disseminated infection among tested mosquitoes (with and without an infected midgut), DE reached its maximum value at 14 dpi (84%) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008475.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), and when examining mosquitoes with infected saliva among tested mosquitoes (with and without disseminated infection), TE reached the maximum of 55.5% at 10 dpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g001">Fig 1Bâ€“1F</xref>), viral loads were similar in abdomen (a mean of 10
 <sup>4.9</sup> viral particles at 3 dpi to 10
 <sup>5.5</sup> at 21 dpi) and head/thorax (a mean of 10
 <sup>5.0</sup> viral particles at 3 dpi to 10
 <sup>5.7</sup> at 21 dpi) at each dpi (Mann-Whitney test: P &gt; 0.05) whereas there were 1,000 to 20,000 times less viral particles in mosquito saliva (a mean of 10
 <sup>2.4</sup> viral particles at 3 dpi to 10
 <sup>1.5</sup> at 21 dpi).
