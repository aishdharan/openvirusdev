<p>For CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV, no significant difference (Mann-Whitney test: P &gt; 0.05) was detected suggesting no relation between viral load in abdomen and viral dissemination (

When pooling all infected mosquitoes and building a ROC curve, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) corresponding to the surface below the ROC curve was 0.8305 showing that the viral load in abdomen discriminated moderately mosquitoes with and without viral dissemination (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008475.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). The threshold that correctly classified the highest number of mosquitoes was 10
 <sup>3.07</sup> viral particles in abdomen. Among mosquitoes with viral dissemination, 96% had more than 10
 <sup>3.07</sup> viral particles in abdomen. However among mosquitoes without viral dissemination, 59% had more particles than this threshold. Of the 28 mosquitoes with viral particles below this threshold, 5 (17.9%) still disseminated. Nevertheless, a significant correlation (ρ = 0.72, P &lt; 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) was detected between viral loads in abdomen and in head/thorax (
