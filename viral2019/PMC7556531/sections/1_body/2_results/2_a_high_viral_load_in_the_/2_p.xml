<p>To define if a high viral load detected in the abdomen can then be associated to viral transmission, viral loads in abdomen-infected mosquitoes were compared between individuals with transmission (i.e. virus detected in saliva) and without transmission (i.e. no virus detected in saliva). For CHIKV, mosquitoes able of viral transmission had a significantly higher number of viral particles in abdomen compared to mosquitoes without viral transmission (Mann-Whitney test: P &lt; 0.05) at 3 dpi (10
 <sup>5.5</sup> versus 10
 <sup>4.1</sup>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and 7 dpi (10
 <sup>6.5</sup> versus 10
 <sup>6.1</sup>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). It was not observed at later dpi (10 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) and 21 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g004">Fig 4E</xref>); Mann-Whitney test: P &gt; 0.05). This pattern was not observed with DENV (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g004">Fig 4K–4N</xref>). When building a ROC curve using all infected mosquitoes, the AUC was equal to 0.7111 showing that the viral load in abdomen weakly discriminated mosquitoes with and without transmission (

 <sup>5.6</sup> viral particles in abdomen. Among mosquitoes with viral transmission, 48% had more than 10
 <sup>5.6</sup> viral particles in abdomen while among mosquitoes without viral transmission, 20% had viral particles above this threshold. The viral load in saliva was only moderately correlated with the viral load in abdomen (ρ = 0.33, P = 0.017) (
