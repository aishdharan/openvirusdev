<p>For CHIKV (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g005">Fig 5F–5J</xref>) and ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g005">Fig 5K–5N</xref>), there were no significant differences (Mann-Whitney test: P &gt; 0.05) suggesting that there was no relation between viral load in head/thorax and transmission. In addition, a ROC curve was built using all mosquitoes with a disseminated infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008475.s003">S3C Fig</xref>); the AUC value was 0.7102 showing that the viral load in head/thorax weakly discriminated mosquitoes with and without viral transmission. The threshold that correctly classified the highest number of mosquitoes was 10
 <sup>5.1</sup> viral particles in head/thorax. Among mosquitoes with viral transmission, 74% had more than 10
 <sup>5.1</sup> viral particles in head/thorax while among mosquitoes without viral transmission, 39% had viral particles above this threshold. The correlation between viral load in head/thorax and in saliva was not significant (ρ = 0.21, P = 0.14).
