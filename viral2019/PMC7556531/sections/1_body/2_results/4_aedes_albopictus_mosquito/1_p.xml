 <italic>albopictus</italic> La Réunion. IRs were 94.4% for CHIKV, 65% for ZIKV and 56.7% for DENV and among abdomen-infected mosquitoes, CHIKV induced the highest DR in mosquitoes (88.2%) while lower DRs were measured for DENV (41.2%) and ZIKV (23.1%). Among mosquitoes with disseminated infection, ZIKV produced the highest TR (66.7%) followed by CHIKV (33.3%) and DENV (14.3%). When considering more globally viral dissemination and transmission among tested mosquitoes, values of DE and TE were respectively for CHIKV (88.3%, 27.8%), DENV (23.3%, 3.3%), and ZIKV (15%, 10%) showing that CHIKV was more efficient to disseminate and be transmitted (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008475.g006">Fig 6B–6D</xref>), no significant differences in viral loads were found between abdomen (CHIKV: a mean of 10

 <sup>6.1</sup>, DENV: 10
 <sup>3.9</sup>, ZIKV: 10
 <sup>1.7</sup>) (Mann-Whitney test: P &gt; 0.05). The viral loads in saliva were much lower: 10

 <sup>0.6</sup> for DENV and 10
 <sup>1.1</sup> for ZIKV.
