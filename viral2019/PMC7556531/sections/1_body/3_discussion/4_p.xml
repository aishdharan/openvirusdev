<p>Approximately 242 dengue infections were imported to Europe by returning travelers from 2012 to 2014 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Up to 36% of dengue-infected travelers became symptomatic after their return and 58% of the patients with acute infections were viremic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The number of imported dengue cases has been increasing in Europe with 2033 cases in 2018 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This poses a risk for autochthonous transmission of dengue in European regions where 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes are present. The fear became reality in 2010 when local dengue cases were reported in France [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], Croatia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and Spain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Further autochthonous dengue cases were reported in France in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and 2018 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Moreover, DENV was detected in a pool of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> at the vicinity of a viremic traveler in Spain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes from Tunisia were weakly competent to DENV necessitating 21 days to excrete viral particles in saliva, which exceeded the 14 days necessary for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> Morocco to transmit DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008475.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This mosquito was also less competent to DENV than mosquitoes from Cameroon and Gabon [
