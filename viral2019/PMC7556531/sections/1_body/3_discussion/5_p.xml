<p>To conclude, the recent establishment of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in Tunisia poses the threat of emergence of CHIKV and to a lesser extent, of ZIKV and DENV considering the vector competence data obtained. Introductions of viremic travelers from endemic countries for these viruses 
 <italic>via</italic> migrant workers or tourists may initiate local transmission when environmental conditions are favorable to sustain high vector densities at proximity of a high proportion of immunologically naive humans. Therefore, control of vectors and surveillance of febrile travelers should be reinforced during the season of high attendance of Tunisia by tourists.
