   <bold>CHIKV infection, dissemination, transmission (A) and viral loads in abdomen, head/thorax and saliva (B-F) in 
    <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> Tunisia at different days post-infection (3, 7, 10, 14 and 21).
   </bold> Mosquitoes were infected with a blood meal at a titer of 10
   <sup>7</sup> ffu/mL and at each day post-infection, mosquitoes were processed to estimate the viral load in abdomen, head/thorax and saliva by titration on cells. On top of the bars are the numbers of mosquitoes tested (A). Means are represented by horizontal bars (B-F). ns, non-significant, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001.
