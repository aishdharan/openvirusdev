<p id="Par25">Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the order Nidovirales. They contain the most abundant RNA genome, with lengths from 27 to 32 kb among all known viruses, and are members of the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae. This subfamily consists of four genera, 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> (α-, β-, γ- and δ-CoV). Specifically, α- and β- coronaviruses mainly infect the human respiratory system, mammalian intestine, and central nervous system; γ- and δ- coronaviruses primarily infect birds (or poultry). The coronaviruses infecting humans can cause severe diseases. To date, seven coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported in humans, namely, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 [
