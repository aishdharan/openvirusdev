<p id="Par27">Canine coronaviruses (CCoV) involve two serotypes, CCoV-I and CCoV-II, which belong to Î±-coronavirus. CCoV-II can be further divided into CCoV-IIa (the classical biotypes and pantropic biotypes) and CCoV-IIb. Classical CCoV-IIa is restricted to the small intestine, causing symptoms such as decreased appetite, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration. Pantropic CCoV-IIa causes subacute bronchial pneumonia and leukopenia (mainly CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells), as well as hemorrhage and necrosis in multiple organs (e.g., kidney and liver) [

Severe cases are often accompanied by coinfection with other viruses. Prevention and treatment of canine coronavirus disease include strengthening hygiene, quarantine, and maintaining water and electrolyte balance. Specific antiviral therapies, such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, are also used [
