<p id="Par28">Feline coronavirus (FCoV) includes feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), both of which are Î±-coronaviruses. FECV usually causes mild intestinal symptoms in cats but self-limiting recovery due to weak toxicity. In contrast, the toxicity of FIPV is generally strong and leads to a high fatality rate, causing systemic inflammatory diseases are known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Generally, FCoV replicates in host intestinal epithelial cells and is excreted with feces [
