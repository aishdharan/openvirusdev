<p id="Par29">Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Î²-coronavirus,</italic> which has high similarity with human coronavirus OC43 in antigenicity and gene sequence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. BCoV can be transmitted through the respiratory and digestive tracts and damages small intestinal epithelial cells or respiratory epithelial cells, causing diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, fever, and sometimes cough and runny nose. BCoV RNA could be detected in the stool of both healthy and diarrheal cattle, and the detection rate was higher in stool samples from diarrheal cattle [
