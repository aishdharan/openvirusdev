<p id="Par31">Both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 belong to lineage A of the genus 
 <italic>β-coronavirus</italic>, which were found in 1967 and 2005, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although the source of HCoV-OC43 remains uncertain, studies have suggested that HCoV-OC43 is closely related to lineage A of the genus 
 <italic>β-coronavirus</italic>, especially bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. HCoV-OC43 typically causes mild respiratory symptoms but infects and leads to severe lower respiratory tract infection in some immunocompromised cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition to upper respiratory tract infection, HCoV-HKU1 can also causes lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], with occasional reported fatal cases. It is rarely reported that the above four human coronaviruses cause digestive disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, approximately 25–38% of patients infected with these four human coronaviruses develop gastrointestinal symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].
