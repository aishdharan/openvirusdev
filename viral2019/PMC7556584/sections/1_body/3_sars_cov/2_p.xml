<p id="Par33">The majority of SARS-CoV enters human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed on lung and gastrointestinal cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the primary methods of pathogenic detection by using upper respiratory tract specimens via throat swabs, lower respiratory tract specimens such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and blood, urine, or fecal specimens. SARS-CoV is persistently positive with intestinal specimen tests for the longest duration, from day 5 after the onset of illness to over 30â€‰days, with the peak at day 11 in some patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In an investigation of 67 patients who were diagnosed with SARS through stool RNA tests, 65 patients (97%) were positive at day 14 after the onset of illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In another cohort study of 75 patients with SARS, nasopharyngeal aspirates from 51 patients showed positive results on day 14 with a nucleic acid test. Subsequently, 15 patients were followed up to day 21, and stool samples from 10 of them (67%) remained positive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This result suggests that the release of the virus via the fecal system occurs for a longer period of time than that by the airways. As a result, detection from different sample types is necessary, and the timeliness of detection is not the same. In addition, patients with gastrointestinal symptoms should have a longer isolation period. Comprehensive judgment is needed during practice.
