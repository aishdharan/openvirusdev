<p id="Par36">This review describes eight coronaviruses that can infect mammals and cause gastrointestinal symptoms and seven human coronaviruses (see TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for details). Coronaviruses that infect mammals have definite intestinal pathogenicity and can cause related clinical manifestations, such as vomiting and diarrhea, in animals, with high lethality. In addition, some coronaviruses in mammals can be transmitted through digestive and respiratory contaminants. The treatments of mammalian disease mainly comprise symptomatic therapy, fluid supplementation and internal environment maintenance, and probiotics are also useful. Gastrointestinal symptoms, receptor binding, positive nucleic acid results and pathological evidence strongly reveal the strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis of the digestive disorders induced by coronaviruses needs to be investigated and revealed.
