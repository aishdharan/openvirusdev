Recent World Health Organization (WHO) statistics revealed an increase of the number of dengue cases reported from 505,430 cases in 2000 to 4.2 million in 2019, among which 70% of the burden is supported by Asia, and a modelling study estimated that 390 million people are infected by dengue virus per year [

Even if these data should be interpreted cautiously, due to changes in declaration systems and the increased number of contributing countries, they do reflect an alarming evolution of dengue virus (DENV) epidemiology. In 2017, WHO estimated that, every year, more than 500,000 people, including a high proportion of children, experience severe clinical presentations that require hospitalization. The number of fatal dengue cases has increased from 960 in 2000 to 4032 in 2015 [
