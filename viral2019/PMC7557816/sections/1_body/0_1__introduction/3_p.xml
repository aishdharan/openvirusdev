<p>DENV are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. Antigenic studies identified four distinct serotypes (DENV-1 to 4) [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Genetic studies confirmed the segregation of DENV strains into four main groups matching with the serotypes, but also into genotype subdivisions that are often characteristic of the geographical origin of the viral strains [

 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,

 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous genetic studies have suggested that the four DENV serotypes emerged from sylvatic cycles in Asia [

 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Dengue outbreaks caused by the four serotypes have regularly been recorded in Asia over the last decades [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. DENV-4 was identified for the first time in the Philippines and in Thailand in 1953 [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since then, DENV-4 has been reported yearly in the Indochinese peninsula, but with a global burden significantly lower compared to the three other DENV serotypes [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. From a genetic point of view, DENV-4 isolates segregate in four different genotypes: Genotype I (Asia) is frequently reported in South East Asia [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; Genotype II (Asia, South Pacific, and South America); Genotype III (Thailand); and Genotype IV (sylvatic strains from Malaysia) [
