<p>Interestingly, DENV-4 has been rarely detected in Lao PDR. Previous studies reported a lower prevalence of this serotype compared to the others in 1990 in Vientiane Capital and in other provinces in 2008–2009 [

 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Only sporadic cases have been detected in villages located around Vientiane Capital in 2006–2007 [

In 2012, an integrated arbovirus surveillance system, involving virologists and medical entomologists, was set up in Vientiane Capital by the Institut Pasteur du Laos and was gradually extended to different provinces in Lao PDR for the detection and monitoring of arbovirus epidemics [
 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This surveillance system detected DENV-4 transmission in 2013 in Vientiane Capital’s suburban areas and subsequently its spread into the different districts of the city and then throughout the country.
