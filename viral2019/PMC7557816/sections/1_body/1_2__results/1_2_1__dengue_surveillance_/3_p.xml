<p>Overall, 11,858 samples (78.4%) were collected in Vientiane Capital, notwithstanding the progressive extension of the surveillance system to other Lao provinces from 2015 and onwards. In 2012 and 2013, DENV serotype identification was mainly performed for isolates collected in Vientiane Capital, which represented, respectively, 80% and 87% of the samples tested. In 2014, only 134 suspected cases were investigated. The dramatically low number of samples tested by the arbovirus surveillance network was consistent with the poor syndromic activity recorded at the country level by the National Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology in charge of the centralization of the mandatory clinical declaration system (
