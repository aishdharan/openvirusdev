<p>A panel of 45 samples, i.e., plasma (
 <italic>n</italic> = 29) or cell supernatant (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16), from DENV-4 cases collected between 2013 and 2019, were investigated for the phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00728-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This panel included samples from different Lao provinces, cases imported from foreign Asian countries, patients with different degrees of dengue severity, and fatal cases. The sequence analysis based on a fragment spanning 1485 nucleotides of the envelop gene revealed that DENV-4 isolates grouped in two different genotypes (i.e., Genotype I and Genotype II) (
