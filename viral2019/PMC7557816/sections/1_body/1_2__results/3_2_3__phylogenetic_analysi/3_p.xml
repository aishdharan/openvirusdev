<p>All autochthonous DENV-4 sequences belonged to the Genotype I. Among the Genotype I, the Lao strains isolated between 2013 and 2019 displayed a maximum nucleotide distance of 2.7% from each other. Interestingly, our series of isolates showed 3.1% to 4.1% of divergence with a Lao strain (KY849762) isolated in 2009 in Saravane province (

Furthermore, several clusters were detected and could emphasize several introduction events in the country from neighboring countries such as Thailand (
