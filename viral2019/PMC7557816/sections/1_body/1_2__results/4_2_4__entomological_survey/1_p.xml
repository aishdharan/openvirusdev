<p>The results of the abundance of the adult dengue vectors collected between 2016 and 2019 are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00728-f006">Figure 6</xref>. A total of 1276 specimens were collected and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was the most abundant species, representing more than 86% of the total. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> represented 14% of the total. The percentage of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> varied between 3.2% in 2018 to 57.8% in 2016 when the study only started in May. In 2017 and 2019, the percentages were 12.6% and 9.9%, respectively. Every year, the vectors were more abundant during the rainy season between May and August, but the mosquito populations remained throughout the dry season albeit at a low level. Of note, no collections were made during the month of April; and in 2016, the collection started in May only.
