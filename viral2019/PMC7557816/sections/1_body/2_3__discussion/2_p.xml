<p>This study highlighted the significant difference in the age of the patients infected with DENV. The syndromic patients infected with DENV-4 were significantly older than the patients infected with other serotypes. The Lao population is young (~40% under 20 years old) (WHO and 
 <uri xlink:href="www.lsb.gov.la" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.lsb.gov.la</uri>) and this data emphasize the risk of dengue emergence in Lao PDR due to a high percentage of the population immunologically naive for DENV. In this study, the mean age (27.4) of the patients infected by DENV-4 appeared to be consistent with studies from other DENV-endemic countries [

 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the fact that syndromic DENV-4 patients were older could suggest the recent emergence of this serotype and/or a low DENV-4 circulation in Lao PDR at least since 2009 [

These findings demonstrate that a large proportion of the Lao population is susceptible to DENV-4 and highlights the need to study the immune status of populations living in dengue-endemic countries in order to predict and prevent future DENV outbreaks as previously done in Lao PDR [

 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, this study highlights the need to perform serotype-specific studies of the immune status of the population.
