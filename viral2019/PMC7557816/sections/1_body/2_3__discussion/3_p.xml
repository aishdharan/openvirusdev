<p>Here, we describe the pre-epidemic circulation of DENV-4 in Lao PDR and the specific features of this serotype during the outbreak in Vientiane Capital and at the country level in the context of DENV serotypes co-circulation. Clusters of DENV-4 infections were identified sporadically several years before the outbreak started. Indeed, serotype-specific surveillance networks are able to finely monitor the profile of DENV circulating and detect early warning signals. Strengthening the prediction capacity of DENV outbreaks by combining syndromic surveillance systems with a laboratory surveillance system has been demonstrated in Lao PDR ([
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; present study). Even if a systematic exhaustive investigation of suspected cases was clearly unrealistic, an appropriate sample size allowed for the drawing of an accurate picture of DENV serotypesâ€™ history in a country over the last eight years. In this way, the actual disease burden of dengue could be calculated, including at the serotype level. The amplitude over time and the burden by serotype and by age groups could be used as proxies to estimate the level of herd immunity in the Lao population. Interestingly, the local lab-based surveillance system in Vientiane city followed the trends of the syndromic surveillance data. Based on this approach, mathematical models could be developed to determine parameters including costs of long-term sustainable, combined surveillance systems.
