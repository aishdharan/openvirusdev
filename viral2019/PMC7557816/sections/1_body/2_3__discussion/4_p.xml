<p>The disease severity of dengue fever was not associated with the predominance of DENV-4 in Lao PDR. Indeed, no significant difference in the disease severity was found between the DENV serotypes in the confirmed samples collected by the arbovirus surveillance network. This finding is in agreement with previous observations, such as during a DENV-4 outbreak in Brazil, which failed to show any link between this serotype and dengue severe symptoms [

Furthermore, in Lao PDR, the fatal cases due to a DENV-4 infection were recorded during the entire outbreak and no link could be established with the number of positive DENV-4 cases. Indeed, in our study, the same number of fatal cases was recorded in 2017 and 2019, respectively, during the peak of the outbreak and at the end of the outbreak. Moreover, dengue fatal cases were observed during the active DENV transmission period, as well as when dengue cases were recorded at a low level.
