<p>DENV emergence and spread are complex mechanisms, especially in endemic countries like Lao PDR. This study shows the need to combine results obtained by the DENV laboratory-based surveillance system and epidemiologic studies, combined with entomological data, along with more research oriented approaches, such as virus genetic, viral kinetic, or virus/vector interaction findings, to determine the impact of these factors on DENV transmission in each specific geographical context.</p>
