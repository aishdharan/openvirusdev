<p>In 2012, an arbovirus surveillance system was set up and coordinated by the Institut Pasteur du Laos. It was first implemented in Vientiane Capital and then progressively extended to hospitals in 18 provinces, with Vientiane Capital’s hospital network being the most active. From 2012 to 2019, human samples were collected through this surveillance hospital network. Suspected dengue fever cases were defined according to the WHO’s definition (fever onset ≥ 38 °C for less than 7 days with at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: headache; myalgia; arthralgia; retro-orbital pain; digestive troubles or hemorrhaging) [

Cases were classified according to the WHO criteria (1997), defining the severity as Dengue fever (DF), Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), or Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Venous blood samples (5 mL) were taken from patients. Samples were stored at 4 °C during transportation to the Institut Pasteur du Laos for analysis and serotypes and genotypes investigation.
