<p>Samples collected by the arbovirus surveillance system were screened by RT-PCR as previously described [
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] with a pan-dengue real-time RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="B57-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and the DENV serotypes were determined with specific real-time RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-09-00728" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].
