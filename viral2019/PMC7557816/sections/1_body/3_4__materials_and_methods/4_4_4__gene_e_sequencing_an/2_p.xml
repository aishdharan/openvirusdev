<p>Gene E sequencing (1485nt) was performed using primers FGT1, FGT2, and F3 (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00728-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). First Stand cDNA were generated using a Maxima H Minus First Stand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the PCR was performed using a Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Kit (New England Biolabs
 <sup>Â®</sup> Inc, Waltham, MA, USA). Amplified fragments were purified using ExoSAP-IT
 <sup>TM</sup> PCR Product Cleanup Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Purified fragments were sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystem, Waltham, MA, USA) on a Genetic Analyzer 3500xL (Applied Biosystem, Waltham, MA, USA).
