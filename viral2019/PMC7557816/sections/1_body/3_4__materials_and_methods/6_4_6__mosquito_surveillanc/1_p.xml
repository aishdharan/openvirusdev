 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00728-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The vectors abundance study took place during both dry and rainy seasons between 2016 and 2019. BG sentinel traps
 <sup>Â®</sup> (Biogents, Regensburg, Germany) were used to follow the dynamics of mosquito population abundance in the city (4 traps per locations, except at Kao-Gnot with two traps).
