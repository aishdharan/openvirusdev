 <caption> Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of DENV-4 sequences from Lao PDR. The tree was constructed on the envelope protein gene (1485 nt). Only the bootstrap values &gt; 70 are shown. Scale bar indicates the nucleotide substitution per site. The Lao strains sequenced in this study are indicated in red and the triangles highlight the strains from fatal cases. The Lao strain previously described is indicated in blue. Black triangles identify isolates obtained from fatal cases. </caption>
