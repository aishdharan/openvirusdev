    "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-the third in a series of coronavirus infections-has caused a global public health event in the 21st century, resulting in substantial global morbidity and mortality. Building on its legacy of managing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), China has played a key role in the scientific community by revealing the viral transmission routes and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and developing novel therapeutic interventions and vaccines. Despite these rapid scientific and technological advances, uncertainties remain in tracing the original sources of infection, determining the routes of transmission and pathogenesis, and addressing the lack of targeted clinical management of COVID-19. Here, we summarize the major COVID-19 research advances in China in order to provide useful information for global pandemic control."
