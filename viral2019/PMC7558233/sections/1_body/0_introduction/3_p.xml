<p id="p0010">Like other common respiratory viruses (i.e., influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus), coronaviruses generally cause mild and self-limited upper respiratory tract infections with clinical manifestations of common cold or mild pneumonia 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Among all known coronavirus species, only six have been identified to cause human diseases as of 2019. The 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 coronaviruses are well documented and mostly result in mild-to-moderate respiratory diseases 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the substantial genetic diversity, frequent recombination, and cumulative mutations of their RNA genomes, along with the notable increase in human-to-wildlife activities, have collectively resulted in a greater likelihood of the emergence of more transmissible and/or virulent pathogens.
