<p id="p0030">In order to more effectively manage the surge of mild-to-moderate cases, makeshift (Fangcang) hospitals with 13 000 beds were temporarily built in large-scale public venues to facilitate the isolation, treatment, and monitoring of confirmed cases, which would help to alleviate the shortage of medical supplies. The establishment of these low-cost hospitals obviated within-household and community transmission; it also helped to release the pressure of patient admissions to designated hospitals and made it possible to triage severe patients promptly. To minimize the risk of transmission, residents without symptoms and/or with a history of close contact yet a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were mandated to isolate at home. These measures eventually proved to be highly effective in flattening the epidemiologic curve. However, challenges in managing ongoing local outbreaks induced by imported cases remain due to the high risk of resurgence in regions such as Beijing, Xinjiang, Dalian, and Hong Kong, which have frequent population immigration.</p>
