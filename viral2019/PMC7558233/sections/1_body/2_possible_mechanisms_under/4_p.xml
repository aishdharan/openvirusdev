<p id="p0045">SARS-CoV-2 employs mechanisms similar to those of SARS-CoV for receptor recognition and cell entry. The spike (S) protein on the virion surface facilitates the entry of the virus into the target cells by attachment to its cognate receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on the cell surface. Transmembrane serine proteases of the target cells, such as FURIN or transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), induce cleavage of the S protein before membrane fusion for cellular entry

Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have also confirmed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a vast array of cells, including lung alveolar epithelial type II cells, nasal goblet cells, cholangiocytes, colonocytes, esophageal keratinocytes, gastrointestinal epithelial cells, pancreatic Î²-cells, and renal proximal tubules and podocytes

Moreover, clinical observations have demonstrated extrapulmonary manifestations, ranging from hematologic, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary, endocrinologic, neurologic, and ophthalmologic to dermatologic systems
