<p id="p0050">SARS-CoV-2 attacks the host through direct tissue damage, endothelial cell damage and thrombosis, dysregulation of the immune response, and disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. COVID-19 infection is accompanied by an aggressive inflammatory response with the release of massive pro-inflammatory cytokines in an event known as the “cytokine storm” 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Plasma collected from COVID-19 patients with pneumonia has shown markedly increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Critical illness in patients has also been associated with an elevated level of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and TNF-α plasma concentrations as compared with mild cases. These events drive the recruitment of immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells into the sites of infection, causing destabilization of endothelial cell to cell and the vascular barrier and diffusing alveolar damage, and ultimately leading to multi-organ failure and subsequent death.
