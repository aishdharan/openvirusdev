<p id="p0055">ACE2 is the key determinant of viral transmissibility. Recent studies have demonstrated that the receptor binding domain of the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 displays a 10- to 20-fold higher binding capacity with ACE2 compared with that of SARS-CoV

 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 shows a gradient of reduced infectivity from the proximal to distal respiratory tract, which coincides with the finding of progressively decreased expression of ACE2 from the oropharynx to the alveoli

SARS-CoV-2 infection might be initiated from the nasal passages, followed by the aspiration of virions seeding along the respiratory tract to the lungs, rather than causing direct lung infection. A more possible process might involve high loads of virus shedding from the initially infected respiratory tract, along with the secretion of mucus accumulating at the oropharynx cavity, and finally arriving at the tracheobronchial tree via aspiration
