<p id="p0060">Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a distinct binding interface to ACE2, with higher affinities and a different network of residue-residue contacts than other coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 has a larger contact area than SARS-CoV with more conserved residues for ACE2 attachment. Unlike coronaviruses with low pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits enhancement of the nuclear localization signals in the nucleocapsid protein and distinct inserts in the spike glycoprotein, which appear to be associated with the high case-fatality rate
