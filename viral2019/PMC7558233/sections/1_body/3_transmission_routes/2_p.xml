<p id="p0070">The major transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be close contact with droplets containing exposed virus or contaminated fomites. Further studies have revealed the presence of viral RNA in various bodily fluid samples, including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, feces, blood, and urine 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, which suggest alternative routes of transmission. In fact, infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions have been isolated from fecal and urine samples. In line with these reports, SARS-CoV-2 productively infects the human gut enterocytes 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and causes notable gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhea in 20%–50% of patients 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Further investigations found that the viral load in feces was markedly higher than that in the respiratory tract between 17 and 28 d after symptom onset, and that RNA fragments—but not infectious virus—were detected in the feces 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. During an episode of diarrhea, infectious virus could be more readily detected in the feces 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Moreover, infectious viruses have also been isolated from urine. Given these findings, appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid fomite transmission.
