Accurate serological tests would enrich our understanding of the personal process of viral exposure, particularly in the monitoring of asymptomatic individuals. Nucleocapsid (N)- and S-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG could be used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the progressively elevated titers after symptom onset (typically peaking at Days 7â€“10). The combined detection of N- and S-specific IgM and IgG may increase the detection rate at early stages. In fact, the combination of N- and S-induced IgM and IgG could be detected in up to 75% of infections within the first week of symptom onset 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The sensitivity of combined detection of N-IgM and N-IgG, or N-IgG and S-IgG, reached 94.7% within the second week
