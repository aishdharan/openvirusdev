<p id="p0095">Given the lack of knowledge regarding the manifestations of COVID-19 and the unclear targets for its prevention, efforts have been expedited to extract the clinical data from the first 41 cases, who were unanimously recruited from Wuhan 
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. To depict the clinical characteristics at the national level, a study was performed to analyze 1099 laboratory-confirmed cases from 552 hospitals across mainland China 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The most common symptoms were fever and cough on admission, while gastrointestinal illnesses such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were uncommon (&lt;5%). The median incubation period was 4 d (interquartile range: 2â€“7 d). The case-fatality rate was 1.4%, which was comparable to the national official statistics in China as of 16 February 2020 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, the case-fatality rate cannot be precisely calculated due to the unclear total number of infected individuals. Importantly, fever was not present on admission in around half of the individuals, suggesting that fever cannot be the sole diagnostic standard for population-based screening of COVID-19. The fact that lymphopenia was common and more prominent in patients with greater disease severity has inspired clinicians to perform clinical trials to validate the effectiveness of interventions against lymphopenia. Furthermore, children are not immune to COVID-19 and most infected children have been found to have a history of recent infections in their families
