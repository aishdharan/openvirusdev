 <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Similarly, recent studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), hypertension, malignancies, and other comorbidities had a markedly higher mortality rate. Elevated levels of ACE2 that were proposed to be associated with an increased susceptibility have been observed in COVID-19 patients with diabetes, COPD, and CVD 
 <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Persons suffering from hypertension may also have increased ACE2 levels induced by heavy dosages of ACE2 inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) during treatment. However, there has been no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affects the severity of COVID-19

 <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Apart from hypertension, patients with cancer were found to be more susceptible due to their systemic immunosuppressive state 
 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Patients with cancer had a significantly higher risk of ICU admission, requiring invasive ventilation, and death 
 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Therefore, patient triage should be based on the presence and spectrum of comorbidities, which would allow for more intensive monitoring among patients at higher risk of developing severe clinical outcomes. Meanwhile, radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be postponed for cancer patients who are clinically stable in order to minimize the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.
