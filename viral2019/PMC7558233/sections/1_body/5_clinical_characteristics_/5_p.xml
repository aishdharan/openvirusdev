<p id="p0110">It is noteworthy that a small proportion of patients remained asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease

 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. The first report of an asymptomatic patient was anecdotal, based on a chest CT scan of an infected child in a familial cluster of cases. Further studies demonstrated that the proportion of asymptomatic patients ranged from 20% to 78% of positive cases

 <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Of the 166 new cases identified on 1 April 2020 in China, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic. Unlike symptomatic patients, hyposmia and nasal congestion were frequent among asymptomatic patients—regardless of whether they had positive CT scan findings or not—but uninfected patients could be excluded by RT-PCR. Asymptomatic patients remained contagious; viral shedding was found to be most prominent before symptom onset, and the duration of shedding might be extended in comparison with symptomatic patients

 <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. However, the population of asymptomatic individuals may be highly heterogeneous, as such individuals may be in the earlier stages of the disease or could remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease.
