<p id="p0130">Dynamic changes in hematologic and immunologic biomarkers might also be valuable for informing clinicians of the severity of COVID-19 and enabling them to postulate the most probable clinical outcomes 
 <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Peripheral blood lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts could serve as predictors for disease recovery. Progressive increases in the numbers of neutrophils, basophils, and IL-6 levels have been found to be associated with a fatal outcome 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Regardless of the disease severity during the initial clinical visit, the absolute lymphocyte count remained substantially lower in non-survivors than in survivors. In addition, higher levels of neutrophil count, IL-6, pro-calcitonin, D-dimer, amyloid A protein, and C-reactive protein have been identified in deceased patients. Marked lymphopenia has also been associated with a fatal outcome; the platelet count was found to be significantly lower in severe patients and even lower in non-survivors. These findings provide a scientific basis for implementing therapeutic interventions targeted at restoring the inflammatory cell count and inflammatory mediators.
