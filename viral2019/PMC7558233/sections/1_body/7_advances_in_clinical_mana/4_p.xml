<p id="p0145">Apart from heightened inflammatory response and viral infections, the aberrant immune response has been the canonical pathophysiological change leading to the poor clinical outcomes. Lymphopenia was identified in up to 80% of patients with COVID-19 and was significantly correlated with the risk of mortality

 <xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Mobilizing the trafficking of lymphocytes to the peripheral blood with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) might represent an appealing therapeutic approach for patients with COVID-19 who have lymphopenia. A recent randomized clinical trial revealed that, despite the failure to accelerate clinical improvement, rhG-CSF markedly increased CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell and natural killer (NK) cell count while reducing the risk of progression to critical illness or death compared with the usual care alone 
 <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>, particularly in patients with a blood lymphocyte count below 400 per cubic milliliter. Mechanistic studies unraveling the mode of actions of rhG-CSF in patients with COVID-19 are needed.
