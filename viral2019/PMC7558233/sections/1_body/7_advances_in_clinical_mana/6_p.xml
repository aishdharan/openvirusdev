<p id="p0155">Targeted therapy has been very limited among critically ill patients with COVID-19. By extrapolating from experience in managing patients with SARS and MERS, efforts have been made to treat critically ill patients with COVID-19 with convalescent plasma. In a pilot single-arm study with five patients, convalescent plasma with high-titers neutralizing antibodies appeared to improve the overall clinical status

 <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. However, convalescent plasma did show clinical benefits in the subgroup of severe patients, albeit not in critically ill patients. 
 <xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref> Nevertheless, the bona fide therapeutic benefits of convalescent plasma cannot be precluded, as the trial was underpowered for analysis due to the difficulty in recruiting patients at later stages of the outbreak. Although there was no statistically significant difference, a possible clinical benefit was observed for patients with severe COVID-19 but not for patient subgroups with a life-threatening level of illness.
