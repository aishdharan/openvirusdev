 <xref rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, as well as a longer prothrombin time, suggested that coagulopathy might be associated with poor prognosis

 <xref rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. Patients with a sepsis-induced coagulopathy score greater than or equal to 4, or a D-dimer level greater than six times the upper limit of normal, exhibited a lower mortality rate when receiving low molecular weight heparin for 7 d or longer
