<p id="p0165">Non-pharmacological interventions might have a role in the clinical management of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 have been characterized by increasingly laborious breathing as a result of greater airway resistance. Due to smaller molecular weight, helium–oxygen mixed gas has been applied to ameliorate dyspnea in patients with respiratory failure 
 <xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref> and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
 <xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. However, due to the low cost-effectiveness ratio, helium–oxygen mixed gas has not been extensively adopted in clinical practice. In contrast, hydrogen/oxygen mixed gas (H
 <sub>2</sub>–O
 <sub>2</sub>) could be generated via the direct electrolysis of water with the use of a commercialized instrument, and could be adopted for home use 
 <xref rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. H
 <sub>2</sub>–O
 <sub>2</sub> inhalation has recently been shown to markedly ameliorate dyspnea in patients with central airway stenosis 
 <xref rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. It is essential to determine whether H
 <sub>2</sub>–O
 <sub>2</sub> inhalation would result in a major clinical improvement in symptomatic patients with COVID-19. In an open-label multicenter clinical trial, H
 <sub>2</sub>–O
 <sub>2</sub> inhalation led to a marked and rapid amelioration of the key respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, chest pain, and cough scale) and improved the resting oxygen saturation and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 who had dyspnea at enrollment 
 <xref rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. Based on these findings, H
 <sub>2</sub>–O
 <sub>2</sub> inhalation has been endorsed by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China for COVID-19 patients with dyspnea or those in facilities without sufficient oxygen supplies
