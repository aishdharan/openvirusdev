<p id="p0185">In public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators are expected to act quickly to support accelerated vaccine development through the introduction of increased regulatory flexibility. To guide the accelerated vaccine development and approval for COVID-19, the Chinese regulatory agencies and the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) have issued seven guidelines since March 2020 to provide a roadmap and requirements

Consequently, completion of the vaccine development and the review may take place simultaneously so that the vaccine development can proceed to clinical application without major delays. For example, the NMPA completed the review process of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine application within just 24â€¯h, although such a review would normally take 60 d. Thus far, there have been ten Chinese COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the pipeline of clinical trials
