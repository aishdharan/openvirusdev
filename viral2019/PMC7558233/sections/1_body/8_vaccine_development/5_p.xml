<p id="p0190">Nearly all of the current human vaccines are based on two major platforms: the virus-based (inactivated/attenuated) vaccine platform and the recombinant protein-based (subunit/virus-like particle (VLP)) vaccine platform

 <xref rid="b0625" ref-type="bibr">[125]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0630" ref-type="bibr">[126]</xref>. Four “inactivated virus vaccines” are in post-phase II clinical trials, and two of these have been approved for emergency use. This major achievement from the “inactivated virus vaccine platform” in China was made possible by the early development of the inactivated enterovirus 71 and inactivated poliovirus vaccines in China. A replication-defective human adenovirus type-5-based COVD-19 vaccine encoding the full S protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a subunit-based vaccine was found to successfully elicit cellular immune responses via single-dose inoculation through the intramuscular or intranasal administration. This vaccine could effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in the higher and lower respiratory tracts
