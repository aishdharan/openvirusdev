<p id="Par23">We recommend inpatients during hospital stay should be provided with as many instructions as possible to stay in wards. Patients should be evaluated in detail under stable condition to minimize the risk of readmission. It is advisable for us to reduce or reschedule post-discharge controls and implement an adequate system of communication for telemonitoring patients in order to reduce hospital visits.</p>
