<p id="Par31">Behavioral assistance robot is withdrawing medicine in the pharmacy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), which can meet the requirements of a wide variety of clinical drugs and reduce the workload or contact and improve the accuracy. Manually monitoring can ensure the entire process is rigorous, accurate, standardized, and safe, which can completely eliminate the inevitable problems of poisoning and pollution in manual operation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Nurse assistant robot looks like a cartoon nurse (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c), which can assist nurses to complete routine nursing tasks, such as procedure handling, environmental guidance, data query, ward inspections, item delivery, and data printing. Robots transport (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d) sterile materials in the OR without touching. Smart assistant robots can help staff in many areas, which are always on call and tireless. With the help of these smart robots, the staff have saved much energy and reduce the contact with patients.
