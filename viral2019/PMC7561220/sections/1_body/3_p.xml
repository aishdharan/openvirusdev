<p>This analysis was limited to men who self-identified as Hispanic/Latino, regardless of race, who were currently taking ART and self-identified as MSM (i.e., gay or bisexual or who reported having had sex with one or more men during the previous 12 months) (1,673). Among HIV-positive Hispanic/Latino MSM, the three components of the ART adherence scale and the ART adherence scale score (dichotomized as ≥85 versus &lt;85 on the basis of the distribution of scores), by selected characteristics, were examined by using weighted percentages with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Characteristics associated with high ART adherence (score ≥85) were assessed by using a multivariable logistic regression model to describe adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with predicted marginal means (

Backward selection was used to determine final model selection, where eligible covariates with significant associations (p&lt;0.05) were retained in the final model. Among persons who reported ever missing ≥1 ART dose (348 during the 2018 data cycle), reasons for most recent missed dose were described; participants could report more than one reason. Sustained viral suppression status was assessed, comparing those with higher adherence (i.e., adherence score ≥85) with those with lower adherence (i.e., adherence score &lt;85), using a univariate prevalence ratio (PR). All analyses were weighted to adjust for individual nonresponse and poststratified to known population totals by age, race/ethnicity, and sex from the National HIV Surveillance System. Analyses were conducted using survey procedures in SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; RTI International).
