<p>The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data ascertained through participant interviews, including information on ART adherence, were based on self-report and might be subject to social desirability or recall bias. Second, results were adjusted to minimize nonresponse bias on the basis of standard methodology; however, the possibility of residual nonresponse bias remains. Finally, reasons for missing ART doses might not be exhaustive.</p>
