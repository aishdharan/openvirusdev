<p>A paradigmatic example of the recent spread of dengue and its epidemic potential was demonstrated in Madeira Island, an autonomous region of Portugal (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008679.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), with an estimated population size of 270,000. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was first detected in Funchal, the capital city of Madeira Island, in 2005 and by October 2012 the island reported its first autochthonous case of Dengue serotype 1 (DENV 1) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The importance of this epidemic is demonstrated by three main reasons: (1) It was the first sustained autochthonous transmission of dengue in the European Union since the 1920s [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; (2) its size, with 1080 confirmed cases (of the 2168 probable cases reported) and 78 cases reported in 13 other European countries in travelers returning from Madeira [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; and (3) the rapid time course of the epidemic, the epidemic peaked within a month after the official report of the first case in October [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] with a rapid decline thereafter with no cases recorded after 3 March 2013.
