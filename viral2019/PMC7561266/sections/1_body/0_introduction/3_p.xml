<p>To understand the complexities of this outbreak, Lourenco and Recker [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] developed an ento-epidemiological mathematical model to explore the ecological conditions and transmission dynamics. Their findings suggest the virus was introduced over a month before cases were reported (in August). In their model, asymptomatic circulation occurred before the two initial autochthonous cases were reported in October, maintaining the virus in the population. Furthermore, their findings indicate that the transmission dynamics and eventual epidemic burnout was driven predominantly by the influence of temperature on the life-history traits of the mosquitoes (incubation period, mosquito mortality and aquatic developmental rates). The seasonal drop in autumn temperatures led to a reduction of the vectorial capacity and effectively stopped the virus propagation.
