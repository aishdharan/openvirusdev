<p>Their findings are consistent with previous experimental work addressing the strong influence of temperature on the life-history traits of the mosquitoes and arbovirus transmissions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These models emphasize the strong, nonlinear (often unimodal) influence of temperature and seasonality on dengue transmission and epidemic dynamics.
