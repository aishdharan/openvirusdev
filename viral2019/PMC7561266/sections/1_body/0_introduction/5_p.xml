<p>Expanding on previous work, we here explore the impact of seasonal temperature variations on the potential epidemic dynamics on Madeira Island. It is imperative to explore the influence of seasonality, as Madeira Island presents with a range of contrasting bioclimates because of its heterogeneous landscape and strong influence from the Gulf Stream and Canary current [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The southern coastal regions of the island (including Funchal), at low altitudes, have higher annual temperatures in comparison to the northern coastal regions or inland regions with higher altitudes and lower annual temperatures [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although the island has not reported any dengue cases since the outbreak in 2012, new introductions would likely result in local transmission given the presence of the vector and permissive environmental conditions. A recent vector competence study with
