<p>We adopt a deterministic compartmental vector-host transmission model exploring chikungunya virus invasion in Florida, United States with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, from [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This was adapted into a standard SEI-SEIR transmission model with one vector, similar to others used in modeling dengue transmission (e.g. in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]).
