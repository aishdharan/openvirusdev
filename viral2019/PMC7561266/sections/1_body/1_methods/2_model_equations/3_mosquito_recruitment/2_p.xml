 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] demonstrate a unimodal seasonal pattern for mosquito activity during the entomological season. The unimodal peak starts around June through to early December, with other months of the year (i.e. January to May) having little to no activity. Using a Gaussian curve, we estimated the timeline for our unimodal peak recruitment to reflect this seasonal pattern as best possible.
