<p>Next, we examine the epidemic dynamics as a function of seasonal temperature variation. Utilizing the same compartmental framework with default starting conditions and parameter values, we ran sets of simulations under two different temperature regimes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. First, we simulated a set of temperature regimes as observed in the historical decadal data for Funchal, Madeira. The mean temperature varied from 19.0 °C to 21.0 °C in increments of 0.2 °C, while the temperature range (i.e.

 </sub>) varied from 4.0 °C to 6.0 °C, in the same increments of 0.2 °C, resulting in 121 simulation runs. The variability in epidemic dynamics is then examined as a function of starting temperature. Starting temperature is defined as the temperature on the day of introduction of the virus (
