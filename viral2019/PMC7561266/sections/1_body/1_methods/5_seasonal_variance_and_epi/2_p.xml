<p>Thereafter, we simulate a wider set of temperature regimes to examine plausible future forcing scenarios based on near-term projections of seasonal temperature changes in the region of Madeira Island. Near term projection refers to projected annual mean temperature changes for the period 2016–2035 relative to a reference period 1986–2005 [

Mean temperature was varied between 15.0 °C to 30.0 °C in increments of 0.2 °C, while range varied from 0.0 °C to 15.0 °C in increments of 0.2 °C (i.e. a total of 5776 simulation runs). It is worth noting that most of the temperatures in this regime are outside projected changes for the island’s region, and very unlikely to occur in Funchal. However, by simulating a wider set of temperature regimes, we can characterize uncertainties and probable outcomes of a local epidemic across other regions on the island. This also allows us to simulate similar extreme temperature conditions already recorded on the Funchal in recent times (for example, high temperatures of 37.8°C on August 5, 2016, and 26.5 °C on December 5, 2018 [
