<p>We examined the timing and size of the epidemic peak as a function of different arrival dates of an infectious human into the susceptible population. An epidemic outbreak occurred only for simulated arrival dates in July to November; with the first epidemic occurring on July 14. Most simulations responded unimodally with peaks occurring few weeks after the arrival of an infectious human, this was typical for summer and early autumn arrivals (i.e. July to September) (
