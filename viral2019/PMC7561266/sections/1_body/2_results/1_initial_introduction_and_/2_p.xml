<p>We examine this behavior further by comparing the disease progression in the human population with that of the mosquito population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008679.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Simulations with an arrival date of the infectious human in October and November had a lower chance to evolve into a unimodal outbreak, because of the depletion of the mosquito population. Following the initial outbreak, a low transmission is maintained until the next seasonal peak recruitment of the mosquitoes before another outbreak. This suggests that the virus can remain viable within the population at low rates, until the next favorable season for transmission. This also means the dynamics of the epidemic is also modulated by the temporal dynamics of the mosquito population, however, this is not the focus of our analysis.
