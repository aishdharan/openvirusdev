<p>Overall, the shifts in epidemic dynamics are driven by the seasonal change (summer and autumn seasons) and its effect on transmission dynamics. The shortest epidemic peak time simulated was 93 days, with 11.4% of the susceptible population infected, with an arrival date of August 29 and a starting temperature of 22.4°C (
