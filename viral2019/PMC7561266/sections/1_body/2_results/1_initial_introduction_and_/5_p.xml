<p>These results show that under the conditions used here, an epidemic potential exists within the summer and autumn seasons, with the most favorable season for a rapid outbreak being the end of the summer season. Epidemics occurring within this favorable period had an average epidemic peak size of 11% of the susceptible population infected, with a time to peak of 95 days. Arrival dates of an infectious human, in the autumn season, can dramatically affect the length of the epidemic, as these outbreaks are also modulated by the mosquito seasonal dynamics.</p>
