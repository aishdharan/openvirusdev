<p>To examine the epidemic dynamics as a function of the seasonal temperature variance, we simulated two different sets of temperature regimes, with a fixed arrival date in mid-summer (August 15). In the first set of temperature regimes (historical;

 </sub> varied from 19.0°C to 22.0°C and 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>range</italic>
 </sub> varied from 4.0°C to 6.0°C, both in increments of 0.2°C), all simulations resulted in an epidemic, with a classical unimodal peak. The timing and magnitude of the epidemic peak both responded differently as a function of starting temperature (calculated for August 15 from

 </sub> using
