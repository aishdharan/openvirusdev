Epidemic peak size had a unimodal distribution with its peak at ~28 °C and steadily declines afterward. Conversely the time to peak starts to increase at ~17 °C to ~19 °C, then steadily decreases until ~28 °C. At this peak of ~28 °C, the epidemic peak size was at 19% of the susceptible population infected, within a short peak time of 73 days. On the other hand, the final epidemic size steeply increases as a function of starting temperature, and plateaus at ~21 °C to ~30 °C (with 100% of the population infected), before steeply declining (
