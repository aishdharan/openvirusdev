<p>To further examine this, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008679.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the variation in the final epidemic size across the annual temperature bands. At a low mean annual temperature of 15°C to 17°C and range of 0°C to ~7.5°C, no epidemic occurred; however, this temperature band becomes suitable for transmission as the temperature range increases beyond this point. Mean annual temperature of ~18°C to ~26°C, supports epidemic transmission at both low and high-temperature ranges. Epidemics introduced within these temperature regimes had the highest epidemic suitability (using final epidemic size as a measure of epidemic suitability). Lastly, mean annual temperature bands of ~27°C to 30°C and low range of 0°C to ~5.0°C, transmission was supported with high epidemic suitability, this steadily diminishes as temperature range increases. In general, under the conditions used here, the dynamics of the epidemic are largely driven by the seasonal variation in temperature.
