<p>All the QIO were sensitive to the interaction term between the arrival date of an infectious human and mean annual temperature and the interaction term between mean annual temperature and temperature range. Another interactive term that was influential to all QOI is the interaction between mean annual temperature and mosquito recruitment. Interactions between transmission rates and other parameters had high relative importance for time to peak, indicating that transmission rates may alter the effect of other parameters (see
