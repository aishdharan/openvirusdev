<p>We extend a previous model for arbovirus transmission with multiple vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to a deterministic compartmental model for dengue fever in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in Madeira Island. This SEI-SEIR model explores dengue epidemic dynamics as triggered by the arrival of an infected person in Funchal, Madeira, and the effects of seasonally varying temperature on transmission. Our analysis focused on three quantities of interest: time to epidemic peak, epidemic peak size, and the final size of the epidemic. We then used a global sensitivity analysis to determine which input parameters were most important to quantities of interest.
