<p>Our model demonstrates that the date of arrival of an infected human in the susceptible human population dramatically affects the overall epidemic dynamics. Arrivals in mid-summer (July) to early-autumn (September) produce epidemics more quickly after introduction with a resulting large final epidemic size. These transient epidemics are indicative of a higher transmission potential at this point of the year and are consistent with the scenario of the 2012 outbreak [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], regarding the time point in the year with the highest epidemic risk and when local control strategies should be intensified. The overall model behavior in response to the timing of virus introduction within the susceptible population is similar to other previous dengue models [
