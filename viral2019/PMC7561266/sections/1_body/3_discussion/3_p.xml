<p>Furthermore, our results show the interaction between seasonal temperature mean and temperature range on the epidemic dynamics. The historical temperature seasonality for Funchal, Madeira, demonstrated a highly suitable thermal environment for the vectorial capacity of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and arbovirus transmission. As expected, given a favorable day of introduction, all our model simulations for this temperature regime evolved into an epidemic, with warmer temperatures at onset producing high prevalence and faster peaks. Our subsequent extension of the temperature regimes demonstrates the nonlinear influence of temperature seasonality on the epidemic dynamics. Likewise, it allowed us to examine plausible future forcing scenarios based on near-term projections of seasonal temperature changes. Overall, the thermal responses from both temperature regimes were similar to those discussed in the works of [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008679.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which investigated the effects of temperature on dengue transmission.
