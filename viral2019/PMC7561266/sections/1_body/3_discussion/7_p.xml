<p>In summary, the model presented here is relevant for the introduction of a new dengue serotype into Funchal, Madeira Island, and the interaction between mean temperature and seasonal variation to drive the epidemic dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential for summer and autumn season transmission of dengue, with varying levels of epidemic suitability, following an introduction of the virus. Overall, we demonstrated that epidemic dynamics are strongly influenced by variation in the date of arrival, seasonal temperature, transmission rates, mortality rate, and the mosquito population. The model sensitivity analysis provides insight into the relative importance of these parameters and their interactive effects as mechanistic drivers of an epidemic. These results can be a useful guide in the development of effective local control and mitigation strategies for dengue fever in Madeira Island.</p>
