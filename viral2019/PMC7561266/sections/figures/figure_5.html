 <caption> Final epidemic size across different seasonal temperature regimes. Heat map of final epidemic size (represented as the proportion of humans infected rather than number) as a function of mean annual temperature and temperature range. Temperature regimes here is given by T mean varied from 15째C to 30째C and T range varied from 0째C to 15째C, a total of 5776 simulations. Default parameters from Table 2 were used for these simulations, except for temperature parameters. </caption>
