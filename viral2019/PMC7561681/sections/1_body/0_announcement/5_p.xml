<p>The second ORF is a 1,249-aa-long structural polyprotein coding for proteins C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1. The mutation E1:A226V was found in none of the new sequences. Instead, the E1:K211E and E2:V264A mutations were found in all new sequences. These mutations were previously found in India and Kenya in 2016 (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and in Thailand in 2018 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These findings suggest that CHIKV strains might have been introduced into Thailand, potentially initiating the epidemics.
