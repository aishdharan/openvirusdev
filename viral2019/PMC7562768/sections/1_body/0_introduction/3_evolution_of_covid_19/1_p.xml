 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] has host-specific spike glycoprotein (S) which binds with the receptor angiotensin I. Binding of S protein with the receptor causes its internalization through phagocytosis. During this process it gets cleaved by cathepsin L within the endosome spreading its infection and precedes fusion [
