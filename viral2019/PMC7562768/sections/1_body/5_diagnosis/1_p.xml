<p id="Par14">Reflection of symptoms of COVID-19 suggests undergoing diagnosis for the confirmation of infection. Next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR is used to diagnose the presence of 2019-nCoV in the respiratory specimen. WHO has released a viral genome sequence for immediate public health in online source virological.org on 10 January (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession number MN908947) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] further on 12 January four other genomes were deposited to Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) which shows its similarity with SARS-related CoV. This data is quite helpful to design primers for PCR. The technique used forward primer 5′-ACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCAGCAGTACGCACACAATC-3′; and the probe 5′CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3′BHQ1. The success of amplification using these sequences confirms the presence of infection. Alternative primer is also available which is listed in Table
