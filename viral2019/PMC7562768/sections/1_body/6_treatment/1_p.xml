<p id="Par17">Researchers are continuously looking for the treatment of COVID-19, a new outbreak. Looking at its similarity with SARS and MERS, the drugs which proved effective against these syndromes were also tried on COVID-19 through in vitro study. Six nucleotide analogous drugs (ribavirin, nafamostat, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, flavipiravir and remdesivir) and one anti-malarial drug (chloroquine) were studied on Vero E6 cell against COVID-19. Each of these drugs was analysed for half-maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>), half cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>), and selectivity index (SI) against the target virus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It was observed that remdesivir is effect even at micromolar concentration with high SI. Remdesivir blocks the viral infection by early terminating the RNA transcription as in SARS/MERS-CoV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] where initial dose of 200 mg and then100 mg for nine consecutive days was approved under trial in February 5, 2020 via intravenous infusion and expected to come up with promising result at the end of April 2020 [
