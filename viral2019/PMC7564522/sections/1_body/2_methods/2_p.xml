<p id="para0012">We used an established deterministic mathematical model of the HIV epidemic in four countries with moderate to high HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa – South Africa (20.4% prevalence

The number of ‘excess’ deaths that are attributed to these disruptions are computed over a five-year period, 2020–2025, in reference to a model projection in which no interruptions occur and coverage of programs expands in the manner that would have otherwise been anticipated.
