<p id="para0027">We compared the effect of each HIV disruption scenario on HIV programmes to the direct effects from a COVID-19 epidemic in each respective country. Three models providing publicly available COVID-19 mortality estimates for each country in the case of an unmitigated epidemic were found via a literature search. Modelled projections from Walker et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> use three scenarios of epidemic spread, with the assumption that the basic reproduction number for COVID-19, R
 <sub>0</sub>, is 2.3 (
