<p id="para0029">The individual effect on HIV incidence and mortality for each type of disruption in the four countries is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref>. In all settings, a decrease in sexual contact rates would result in a period of reduced HIV incidence, with incidence quickly returning to its previous levels soon after the disruption ends. In contrast, a 50% reduction in condom use would have the greatest effect on increasing incidence during the disruption. Reductions in viral suppression and interruptions in ART would also cause increases in incidence, though likely of a lesser magnitude. A temporary pause in the expansion of VMMC programmes would not be expected to have a large effect at this scale, in comparison.
