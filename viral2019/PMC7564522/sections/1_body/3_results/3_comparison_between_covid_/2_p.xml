 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the comparison between the projected COVID-19 deaths and the corresponding projections of additional HIV-related deaths caused by the patterns of disruptions assumed in the different scenarios in 
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the projections, COVID-19 deaths are expected to be limited to the first year because the projections show the epidemic ending within that time, although it is possible that a mitigated epidemic would last longer than one year. This contrasts with the projections for HIV-related deaths, which continue to occur through 2025 and beyond.
