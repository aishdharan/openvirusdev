<p id="para0033">For both the ‘Managed Pause’ and ‘Managed Disruption’ scenarios, excess mortality over five years is limited to, respectively, a 1 or 2% increase from the expected HIV-related mortality over this period. However, in the ‘Interruption of Supply’ scenario in which 40% of individuals are assumed to experience an interruption in ART supply for three months, the excess number of deaths caused over the five-year period is substantial. In all countries, this would be comparable to the number of COVID-19 deaths that are projected to be potentially averted by implementing social distancing or enhanced social distancing by the Walker et al. and Pearson et al. projections, and comparable to the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the Cabore et al. projections.</p>
