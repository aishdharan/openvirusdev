<p id="para0034">Given that little data are available about the mortality risk for individuals who have an interruption in ART, and that the extent and duration of any disruption of ART is unknown, we modelled a range of potential durations of interruption, the proportion of PLHIV on ART affected, and the associated increase in HIV mortality over 5 years (

 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> with the assumption of an unmitigated epidemic but a lower R
 <sub>0</sub>). This reveals that the relative scales of projected COVID-19 deaths and HIV deaths that might be caused by disruptions to services are both highly uncertain but overlap for plausible sets of assumptions.
