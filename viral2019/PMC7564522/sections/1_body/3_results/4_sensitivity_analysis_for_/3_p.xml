<p id="para0035">Under the median mortality risk assumption, an interruption of ART lasting for nine months would lead to an additional number of HIV-related deaths equalling the total deaths caused by COVID-19 in these settings according to the Cabore et al. projections, if the interruption affected at least 6% of those currently on ART. If the comparison is made with the Walker et al. or Pearson et al. projections for COVID-19 deaths, then the same number of deaths would be caused if 47% or 90% of those on ART had their treatment interrupted, respectively. For the Cabore et al. projections, an interruption of ART for one month for at least 60% of PLHIV on ART could equal the total COVID-19 deaths, whereas for the Walker et al. and Pearson et al. projections, the minimum duration of an ART interruption to match the estimated number of COVID-19 deaths would be five and nine months, respectively.</p>
