<p id="para0036">For the lower assumed mortality risk for those off ART, the number of HIV-related deaths would increase by a maximum of 34% if all individuals stopped ART for 12 months, which would approximately equal the number of COVID-19 deaths with enhanced social distancing according to the Walker et al. model. For the higher assumed mortality risk, HIV-related mortality could reach a maximum 135% increase in over five years and the number of HIV-related deaths could exceed more than two times the number of COVID-19 deaths in the Pearson et al. model, five times the number of COVID-19 deaths in the Walker et al. model, and 29 times the number of COVID-19 deaths in the Cabore et al. model.</p>
