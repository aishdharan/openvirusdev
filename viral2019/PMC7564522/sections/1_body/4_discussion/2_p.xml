<p id="para0037">Maintaining ART treatment during any health system disruptions that might occur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is the overriding priority for HIV programs. A wide-spread and long-lasting interruption to ART supply could cause additional deaths on the same order of magnitude as those which could be saved by interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic or match the deaths resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic itself. Some of the negative impacts of service disruption could be minimised by policy changes that are beneficial to HIV programs in the long-term â€“ for example, adaptations to ART delivery, such as multi-month ART prescriptions or dispensation of medication outside of health facilities, are now recommended for consideration in appropriate circumstances by the WHO and PEPFAR [
