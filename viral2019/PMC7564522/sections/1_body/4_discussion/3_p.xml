<p id="para0038">Some short-term changes to programs, such as scaling back new VMMC procedures and reduced availability of condoms, may be less impactful in terms of the excess number of deaths in the medium-term, but new HIV infections could increase as a result and have further long-term ramifications not captured by the five-year time horizon. This would particularly true for disruptions lasting longer than three months. It is also notable that the number of life-years lost to each COVID-19 death may be fewer than those lost to HIV-related deaths, given the strong relationship between COVID-19 mortality and age [

The analysis presented here is for four countries with different population sizes and levels of HIV prevalence, but it is anticipated that the overall direction of the results will be similar for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa with large HIV epidemics. Another study comparing different disruptions to HIV services across five models found broadly similar results for an interruption of six months for 50% of those on ART in sub-Saharan Africa, while our results provide a complementary exploration of the uncertainty in such mortality estimates
