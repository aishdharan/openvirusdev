<p id="para0039">There are several important limitations to this analysis. First, we do not model any interaction between HIV or ART status and COVID-19 infection â€“ that is, PLHIV are not assumed to be more or less likely to acquire or die from COVID-19. This may need to be revised as more information becomes available and could influence outcomes, particularly in areas with large numbers of PLHIV who are not virally suppressed. Second, the effect of a disruption on the risk of mother-to-child transmission is not included in this model and could result in further deaths and infections not represented here. Third, possible increases in drug resistance due to ART regimens being disrupted are not included, but these could also contribute to excess HIV deaths in the longer term 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Fourth, the monthly risk of death is likely to increase over time as individuals accrue time off ART; however, this is not represented in the model. In addition, there may be a great degree of heterogeneity among individuals experiencing an interruption of ART, with those having a history of low CD4 counts and opportunistic infections more likely to have a substantially higher mortality risk than those with many years of ART or high CD4 counts. Finally, disruptions could last longer than represented here and if this were to result in defunding of HIV programmes, the outcomes could be even more catastrophic.
