<p id="para0040">We have also assumed a universal reduction in sexual risk behaviour during the interruption, but any changes in sexual risk behaviour as a result of COVID-19 interventions are not currently known. A reduction in sexual contacts could reduce incidence rates and hence new infections but would have a limited impact on the number of deaths over five years. Furthermore, interruptions to condom supplies could counteract any incidence decline. Reductions in condom availability could also have differential impacts on new HIV infections among different populations; for example, female sex workers might be at higher excess risk than women in stable partnerships. Ensuring support for community prevention programs during the COVID-19 epidemic will help to mitigate these potential effects.</p>
