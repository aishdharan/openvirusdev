<p id="para0041">There is also a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the extent of mortality due to COVID-19 in African countries. Three models have released projections of estimated deaths caused by COVID-19 in each country [
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A model by Cabore et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> from the WHO Regional Office for Africa projects substantially lower mortality (75–94% lower than the Walker et al. projections and 86–97% lower than the Pearson et al. projections with enhanced social distancing for the four countries in this analysis), due to an assumed lower risk of transmission compared to the other models. The relative strengths of the modelling approaches may be debated, but these varied projections show the range of impacts that are being discussed and such context is important: if COVID-19 deaths are closer to those predicted by Cabore et al., even a small proportion of individuals experiencing an interruption in ART, or a larger proportion for a short period of time, could lead to more deaths than from COVID-19 itself. Furthermore, HIV deaths resulting from an interruption in supply could exceed the number of COVID-19 deaths averted by implementing social distancing in both Walker et al. and Pearson et al. It is also possible that the number of COVID-19 deaths occurring beyond 2020–21 could be higher than estimated by these models if a vaccine or effective therapeutic is not found or if suppression strategies delay an epidemic to a later time period.
