<p id="para0042">The assumptions made in this analysis are not predictions of the future, but hypothetical scenarios designed to highlight the importance of maintaining different services during COVID-19 epidemics. The model itself has many limitations, as noted above. Outside of these, the major uncertainties in this analysis can be classified into four groups: (1) uncertainty about the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (both how far and fast will it spread and with what probability of death for those infected); (2) uncertainty into the extent to which HIV programs will actually be disrupted by the COVID-19 epidemic and the response to it; (3) uncertainty about changes to patterns of sexual risk behaviour in response to the epidemic; and (4) uncertainty about the mortality risk of those persons on ART who may suffer an interruption in the supply of drug. The range of mortality effects due to ART disruption will depend on the health and immune status of the person, the drugs they are using and their treatment history, as well as any steps that are taken to prolong supply (e.g., alternate day dosing). It is also possible that interruptions to services could be handled in a more nuanced way than assumed here, for example by prioritising maintenance of ART for those with treatment histories that indicate a greatest risk of opportunistic infections or death. For these reasons, we have repeated the analysis for a wide range of values, but even within this, it may be that the effect has been over- or under-estimated. Empirical data collection would help refine our analysis further, particularly data on ART stock levels in-country, anticipated supply chain issues, and the mortality risk for individuals experiencing time off ART.</p>
