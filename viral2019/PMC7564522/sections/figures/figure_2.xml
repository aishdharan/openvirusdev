  <p>Projected direct and indirect deaths over time for South Africa (A), Malawi (B), Zimbabwe (C), and Uganda (D), under different assumptions about the COVID-19 epidemic in Walker et al. and the impact on HIV services (
   <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), for a three-month service interruption. The purple bars for COVID-19 deaths represent estimates from Walker et al. The whiskers represent estimates from Cabore et al. and Pearson et al. for an in an unmitigated epidemic, and Pearson et al. only for an epidemic with social distancing and enhanced social distancing from

   <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
   <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Deaths averted by implementing social distancing and enhanced social distancing are from Walker et al. Yellow bars represent HIV deaths in the ‘interruption of supply’ scenario; red bars represent HIV deaths in the ‘managed disruption’ scenario; blue bars represent HIV deaths in the ‘managed pause’ scenario (all from 
   <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Confidence intervals for the HIV mortality scenarios represent uncertainty in the mortality risk for individuals with interrupted ART, ranging from a mean monthly mortality risk of 0.10% to 0.44%.
