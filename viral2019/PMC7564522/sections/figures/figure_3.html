 <caption> The excess HIV deaths over 5 years caused by the disruptions, as a percentage of the total number of HIV deaths expected without the disruptions. Results give the mean across the four countries considered – South Africa, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Uganda. Plots shown give this metric with respect to the duration of interruption in months (vertical axes) and the proportion of people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) affected by the interruption (horizontal axes). The panels show the results under three different assumptions about the average net monthly mortality risk for those experience an interruption in ART supply: (A) 0.10%, (B) 0.24%, and (C) 0.44%. Contour lines show where the total number of deaths is greater than the deaths expected for COVID-19 epidemics, averaged across the four countries, for three different models of COVID-19 (Cabore et al., [12] Walker et al., [3] and Pearson et al. [11]). Light red lines correspond to the mean number of COVID-19 deaths in the four countries in Cabore et al.; orange and blue lines correspond to the mean number of COVID-19 deaths with enhanced social distancing in the four countries in Walker et al. and Pearson et al., respectively. Dashed lines correspond to the base case scenario of 40% of individuals experiencing a three-month interruption of ART. </caption>
