<p>ASFV is the sole member of the 
 <italic>Asfarvirus</italic> genus within the 
 <italic>Asfarviridae</italic> family, and is the unique Arbovirus whose genome is double-stranded DNA, ASFV genome shows significant variations in length from 170 to 194 kb, which mainly results from gain or loss of different members of multigene families (MGF) [
