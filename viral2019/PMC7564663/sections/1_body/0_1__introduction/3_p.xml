<p>The genome of ASFV is huge and complex, showing obvious genetic diversity. There are currently eight serotypes based on the viral hemagglutinin CD2-like protein (CD2v) and C-type lectin. According to the sequence of B646L, which encoding the major capsid protein p72, ASFV can be divided into 24 genotypes (I-XXIV) [
 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00531" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ASFV was first described in 1920s, and all the above genotypes can be detected in Africa. The genotype I ASFV emerged in Europe in 1950s and was eradicated in Europe except Sardinia by the mid-1990s. The genotype II ASFV was mainly prevalent in southeastern Africa. In 2007, it was introduced to Georgia, then continued to spread across the Caucasus region and into Russian Federation and Eastern Europe [

 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00531" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In early March 2017, the genotype II strain spread eastward across a long distance to Irkutsk in Russiaâ€™s Far East region and near the border of China [
