<p>At present, effective control of ASF has not yet been achieved in Asia and Europe, which poses a serious threat to the global pig industry. No available vaccines against ASF leaves the control of the disease to early detection by efficient diagnosis, the culling of infected and exposed animals, and strict sanitary measures. Lack of in-depth understanding of the prevalence, transmission mechanism and pathogenicity of ASF has brought great difficulties to the prevention and treatment of ASF in China. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current epidemic situation and factors of ASF in China. The second half of this review covered the recent progress and emerging approaches to ASF vaccine design. We look forward to delivering helpful information for the next generation of ASF vaccines to leap over hurdles.</p>
