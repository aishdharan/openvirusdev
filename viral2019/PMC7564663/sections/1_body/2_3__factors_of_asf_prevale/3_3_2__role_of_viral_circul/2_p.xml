<p>ASFV can be transmitted horizontally in infected pigs. The virus content in the blood of highly acute attack pigs is very high, which provides favorable conditions for the direct or indirect transmission of the virus. The virus also exists in urine, nasal secretions, saliva and other excreta and spreads through short distance aerosol. In addition, direct contact with contaminated surfaces, feed feces or water can indirectly lead to pig infection. All of these pathways contribute to the persistence of ASFV in pigs [
