<p>Wild boars have a wide scope of activities, ASFV can survive in infected wild boar carcasses and environment for months, and mechanical transmission of pathogens will occur once the carcasses are eaten by other carnivores or birds. Different from warthog and giant forest pigs in Africa, Eurasian wild boar (
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) lack resistance to ASFV and have a high mortality rate once infected. Since 2014, 95% of reported ASF outbreaks in Europe have been wild boar infections, and ASF persistence has been maintained through transmission between wild boars in the absence of domestic boars [
 <xref rid="B28-vaccines-08-00531" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Four ASF outbreaks in wild boar have been reported so far in China. On 16 November 2018, the first outbreak in wild boar was confirmed in Hunjiang District, Baishan City of Jilin Province, and though there was no direct connection with domestic pig infection, the source of infection remains unknown [
 <xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00531" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In China, wild boar population is quite large, including both natural and farmed wild boars, whose density is estimated to be 2â€“5/km
 <sup>2</sup>, and widely distributed in Fujian, Guangdong, Northeast China, Yunnan-Guizhou region, etc. It is estimated that the number of wild boars in the whole country has reached millions now [
 <xref rid="B30-vaccines-08-00531" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite the reported outbreaks in China mainly in swine, the potential risk of ASFV transmission from wild boars to swine is high based on the huge population and wide distributed of wild boar in China. Wild boar, as a natural host, once intervened in the infection cycle chain, it is likely to form a natural epidemic focus, which would greatly increase the control difficulty and is not conducive to the eradication of ASF [
