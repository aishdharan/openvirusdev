<p>ASFV can persist in soft ticks for a long time and be infectious. Susceptible pigs are infected by ingesting soft ticks carrying ASFV or their bites [

Though there is no report on the ASF outbreaks caused by tick transmission in China yet. However, there are more than 100 species of ticks in China. Once the virus is carried by ticks, it will be more difficult to eradicate, and the risk of long-term existence of the virus will increase accordingly. The study on the role and mechanism of ticks in the transmission of ASF in China will be conducive to take effective measures to control the ASF epidemic in time.
