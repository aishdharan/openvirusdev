<p>Trans-regional transportation of live pig and pork products is an important consideration for the rapid spread of ASF in China. The pig trade occupies a large market share of breeding industry in China. Due to the uneven distribution of pig origin in China, line-haul of pigs cannot be avoided. In addition, the early diagnosis of ASF is difficult and its clinical symptoms are not obvious, easy to confuse with diseases such as Classical Swine Fever (CSF). Line-haul of infected pigs directly results in rapid spread of the virus. Legal trade of live pigs may spread ASF during high-risk periods (HRP). Gao Xiang et al. found that the southeast of China had the highest risk of ASFV transmission through legal pig trade, especially in colder months [

Therefore, in order to avoid the expansion of the epidemic scope, off-site transportation of live pigs and pork products is forbidden in many places. The limited transportation of live pigs immediately led to a rise of pig prices, and illegal pig transportation and frozen meat smuggling, which further resulted in the long-distance transmission of ASFV. In view of this, the MARA had strengthened the supervision and management of the transfer of pigs and their products, implemented measures such as registration and filing of pigs transport vehicles, inspection of transportation links and detection of slaughter links to crack down on illegal activities. Controlling the movement of pigs and transport of products seems to be effective, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of outbreaks from 35% to 15% [
