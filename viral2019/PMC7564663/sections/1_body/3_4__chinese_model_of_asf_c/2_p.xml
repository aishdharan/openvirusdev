<p>Currently, there is no safe, effective and commercially available ASF vaccines, so there is no way to control susceptible animals. The prevention and control of ASF in China focuses on eliminating the contagium and polluter, and cutting off the transmission route, which will be a long-term work. Contagium and polluter mainly include dead and infected pigs, especially the infected pigs without clinical symptoms, which should be culled and harmlessly treated, and forbidden to enter the transportation, sale, and slaughtering links. It is necessary to strengthen the cleaning and disinfection of transport vehicles and the isolation of personnel; drying, high temperature granulation, acidification of polluted feed materials; drying and disinfection of polluted materials, disinfection and acidification of polluted water sources, cleaning and maturation of polluted food materials, and the measures mentioned above are intended to completely inactivate ASFV in the environment. In addition, appropriate measures should be taken to prevent the mechanical transmission of ASFV by fly/mosquito/bird. Finally, transport, slaughter, and feed enterprises, meat processing enterprises should do a good job in the biosecurity system of ASF and adopt some corresponding technologies to eliminate potential pollution sources [
