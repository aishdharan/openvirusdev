<p>Although ASFV was discovered as early as the beginning of the 20th century, vaccine research has lagged behind for more than 40 years, which may be related to its obvious genetic diversity, showed by the very large and complex genome of ASFV. Thus far, the exact mechanism of the host protective response has not been fully determined and protective antigens remain to be identified, which seriously hinders the development of vaccines. The lack of effective treatments or vaccines against ASF complicates the control of ASF in China. Consequently, we reviewed the research history and recent progress of ASF vaccines in order to provide reference for the research and development of ASF vaccine in China. Despite the obstacles, a few laboratories devoted to ASF vaccine research have made several pioneering discoveries in this field. For example, some candidate strains of gene-deleted vaccines can provide complete cross-protection, and are expected to be put on the market in the near future [
