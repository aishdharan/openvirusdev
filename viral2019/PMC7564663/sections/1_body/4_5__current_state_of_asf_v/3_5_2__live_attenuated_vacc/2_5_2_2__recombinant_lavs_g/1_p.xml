<p>ASFV encodes a variety of proteins to inhibit and evade the host immune response by regulating host cell protein expression, interfering with the innate immune system and regulating cell cycle, which creating favorable conditions for self-proliferation and proliferation (
 <xref rid="vaccines-08-00531-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). An appropriate balance between attenuation and immunogenicity may be achieved by exploring ASFV-encoded genes involved in replication, virulence, and immune evasion, which is conducive for the design of rationally gene-deleted vaccines. Additionally, technologies including reverse genetics, gene editing, or homologous recombination provide an auxiliary means to develop next generation gene-deleted vaccines, which is coming closer to the market in the short-term.
