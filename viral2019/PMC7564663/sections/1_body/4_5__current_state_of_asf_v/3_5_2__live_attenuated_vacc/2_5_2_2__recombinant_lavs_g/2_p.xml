<p>In view of the recent five years of research on gene-deleted vaccines (
 <xref rid="vaccines-08-00531-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), most of them can resist the attack of homologous parental strains after vaccination. In 2015, Oâ€™Donnel et al. vaccinated pigs with a low dose of the virulent strain Georgia 2007 with the 9GL gene-deleted, which can induce complete protection of pigs against homologous parental viral attack at 28 days post immunization. Simultaneously, the team knocked out six genes of MGF360/505, multigene families 360 and 505 of Georgia 2007, and obtained candidate vaccine strains with similar replication ability as parental virus but fully attenuated in pigs, which could completely resist the attack of parental strains after vaccination. Moreover, a deleted strain after knockout the 9GL and UK virulence genes could provide homologous protection only at 14 days post immunization [

(2017) reported that, after knocking out the DP148R of Benin97/1, an attenuated strain with similar replication ability to the parent virus was obtained, which could induce high levels of protection against the homologous strain [
