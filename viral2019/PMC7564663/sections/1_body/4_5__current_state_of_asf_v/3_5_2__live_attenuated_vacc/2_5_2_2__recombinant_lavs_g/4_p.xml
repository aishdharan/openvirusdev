<p>Although most of the gene-deleted vaccines without ASFV-related virulence genes can provide complete protection, there is still a risk of virulence returning due to the residual virulence. The new investigation showed that the attenuated strain HLJ/18-6GD obtained by deletion of six genes of MGF360/505, multigene families of China HLJ/2018 strain, could protect pigs from the attack of parental virulent stains. However, its safety assessment data indicated that HLJ/18-6GD has a high risk of converting to a virulent strain. In the groupâ€™s latest study, the HLJ/-18-7GD, which further deleted the CD2v gene, was obtained to eliminate this risk, fully attenuated, and with a low risk of converting to a virulent strain, and could provide complete protection in pigs against lethal ASFV challenge. HLJ/-18-7GD is a safe and effective vaccine against ASFV [

The safety of ASF gene-deleted vaccines is critical for practical application, therefore, it is necessary to study the genetic stability and determine the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccines within a certain dose range.
