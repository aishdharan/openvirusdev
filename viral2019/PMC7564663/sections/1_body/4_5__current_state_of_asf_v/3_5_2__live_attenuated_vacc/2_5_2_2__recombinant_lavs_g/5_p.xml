<p>At present, the main factors restricting the development of ASFV gene-deleted vaccines are still insufficient research on virulence-related genes and immune escape mechanisms of ASFV, as well as subclinical symptoms and viremia caused by vaccination. A recent study described that a method of rapid isolation and purification of the deleted strain by combining the conventional homologous recombination with fluorescence-activated cells sorting (FACS) may greatly facilitate studies on understanding ASFV gene functions and accelerate the development process of recombinant live attenuated vaccine to some extent [
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-08-00531" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is believed that the optimal combination of gene-deleted vaccines can be obtained on the basis of clarifying the biological functions of more unknown genes of ASFV.
