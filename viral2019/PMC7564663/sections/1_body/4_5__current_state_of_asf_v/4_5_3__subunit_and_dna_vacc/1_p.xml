<p>At present, ASF genetically engineered vaccines, such as subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and virus vectored vaccines, provide a targeted approach with fewer side-effects and higher safety. As is shown in 
 <xref rid="vaccines-08-00531-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, We summarized ASF genetically engineered vaccines evaluated in recent years. Several ASFV proteins (p30, p54, p72, CD2v, EP153R, p12, D117L, pp62, etc.) have been studied and reported as the main targets of ASF vaccines, and the immune protective ability of these proteins has been tested, including individual ASFV antigen target or multi-target cocktail vaccination.
