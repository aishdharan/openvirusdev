<p>At present, most of the protective antigens of ASFV that used in current subunit vaccines are insufficient to provide complete protection for vaccinated pigs. On the whole, with only a few ASFV proteins as antigens, it is difficult to provide effective immune protection even if neutralizing antibodies are emerged [

 <xref rid="B93-vaccines-08-00531" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], they still cannot fully resist the challenge of virulent strains. The ASFV coding genes screened by DNA vaccination may play an established role in dissecting the immune mechanism and participating in the protection of ASFV antigens, but there is still a long way to go to achieve the goal of providing effective immune protection.
