<p>In the previous discussion, we found that DNA vaccines can induce broad-spectrum immune responses, and DNA-protein immunity may help to identify virus antigen-specific responses, which can provide more potential information for the development of more efficient and safer ASFV subunit vaccines. In 2019, the combination of ASFV recombinant protein (p15, p35, p30, p54, CD2v-E) and pcDNA3.1 encoding ASFV gene (CD2v, p30, p72, CP312R) was selected to immunize pigs with ISA25 adjuvant. The results showed that pigs vaccinated with ASFV DNA+ protein could activate cell-mediated immune response, in which p72 was the main inducer of IFN-γ [

In the current study, the mechanism of synergy between specific ASFV proteins and pcDNAs encoding ASFV genes is elusive, and it is likely that pcDNAs trigger some nonspecific immune responses, thereby enhancing the specific response to these proteins. At the same period, Sunwoo et al. vaccinated pigs three times with a mixture of ASFV plasmid DNA (CD2v, p72, p32, +/−p17) and recombinant protein (p15, p35, p54, +/−p17). The vaccinated pigs, although producing antigen-specific antibodies, they lacked the ability to neutralize the virus, and as a result, were unable to resist ASFV Armenia 2007 strain challenge, and markedly enhanced pathological changes were observed in vaccinated pigs [

Immune-mediated increases in ASFV infection and disease have occurred in several vaccine challenge studies, including those mentioned above, and these ASFV immunogens are likely to cause more severe symptoms due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) affecting neutralizing antibody production.
