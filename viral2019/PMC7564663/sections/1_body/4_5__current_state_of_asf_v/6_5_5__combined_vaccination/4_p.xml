<p>What antigen can play a protective role and how to orient the antigen to a specific presentation pathway are the urgent problems to be solved in the development of ASFV genetically engineered vaccine at present. Combining the diversity of existing virus strains, further exploring the potential protective antigens of ASFV and the optimal immune mechanism to be triggered after vaccination, the use of multiple ASFV antigens or antigen fragments, adjuvants, and complex formulations of expression vectors are a new paradigm for the development of ASFV genetically engineered vaccines.</p>
