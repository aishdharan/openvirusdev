<p>Since the first occurrence of ASF in China in August 2018, the epidemic has spread continuously and rapidly throughout the country. The wide distribution of wild boars and soft ticks in China may make it easier to form a natural epidemic focus of ASFV. In addition, the diversified breeding patterns, high breeding density, and weak biosafety awareness of practitioners make the situation of prevention, control, and eradication of ASF in China very serious. As there is still no commercial vaccine available, the domestic strategy for ASF prevention and control relies largely on the strict biosecurity system. Developing safe and effective animal vaccines will help control and eradicate ASF from wild boars and domestic pigs in China. </p>
