<p>At the present stage, China has initiated special studies on major basic scientific issues of ASFV, vaccine creation, detection technology, epidemiology, special disinfectants, and vector control, which provide important scientific and technological support for ASF prevention and control in China. In addition, the phased results of ASF vaccine research and development in China have greatly encouraged the confidence to overcome ASF. As stated in the report on the situation of ASF from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), interregional cooperation should be encouraged to combat the spread of this cross-border transmitted disease. Controlling ASF will be a challenging long-term battle that requires the joint participation and coordination of all national and international stakeholders.</p>
