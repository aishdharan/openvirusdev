<p id="d1e2311">Since late 2019, the COVID-19 respiratory disease originating from the SARS-CoV-2 virus 
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> has caused a global pandemic, leading to over 9 million confirmed cases and over 660,000 confirmed deaths as of June 2020 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. As the epicentre of the pandemic has shifted from Asia to Europe and the Americas, governments across the world have taken steps to curb the spread of the disease. Due to the current lack of a vaccine for COVID-19, and the current very limited number of therapeutic agents available for treatment of COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, these efforts have taken the form of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).
