<p id="d1e2350">In this work, we address the tradeoffs between mitigation and suppression for a specific country case (Ireland). We use official epidemiological data to generate a standard SEIR-type model for the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland. Thereafter, we carry out a counter-factual exercise and look at what would be the optimal strategy of NPIs to reduce the effective reproduction number of the disease while simultaneously minimizing the cost to the national economy. The basic methodology is a standard compartmental SEIR model with multiple additional compartments for fitting the model to the extant data; the model is deterministic and based on coupled ordinary-differential equations. Thereafter, the model is reformulated in the context of Optimal Control Theory â€” the model is solved in such a way as to minimize a cost function, while satisfying certain state constraints which correspond to the requirement that hospital admissions remain below capacity for the duration of the outbreak.</p>
