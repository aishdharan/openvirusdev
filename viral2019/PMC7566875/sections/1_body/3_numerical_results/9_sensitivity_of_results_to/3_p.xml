The motivation is that this is a realistic time horizon over which to manage the spread of COVID-19 in population, before the advent of anticipated therapeutic interventions such as anti-viral drugs and vaccines. Introducing a variable time horizon for the optimal control problem can be addressed in future work — the same observations as above will apply, namely the importance of suppressing the initial exponential growth of the epidemic.
