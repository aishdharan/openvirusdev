<p id="d1e10348">Summarizing, we have introduced a mathematical model to describe the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland in March–May 2020. Based on this model, which we compare to actual epidemiological data, we have used numerical methods from optimal control theory to answer a hypothetical question — what would have been the optimal strategy for the control of the epidemic? The optimal control theory is based on minimizing a cost function which is related to the cost to the economy of the various control measures. At the same time, the theory introduces state constraints as a means of maintaining the number of infectious cases below a maximum threshold such that hospital capacity is not overwhelmed. By insisting on piecewise-constant controls (appropriate for modelling rather crude population-level public-health interventions) and state constraints, the optimal-control model is not amenable to theoretical analysis — hence a numerical approach is considered. As such, we have performed the necessary optimizations via numerical simulated annealing — the results show that a suppression strategy (implemented promptly) is superior to a mitigation strategy.</p>
