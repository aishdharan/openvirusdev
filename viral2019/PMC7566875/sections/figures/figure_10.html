 <caption> Black line: Plot of k I S ( t ) under an optimal-control strategy in which the boundary is attained. Control parameters: n = 6 , u m a x = 0 . 68 . Other curves: plot of k I S ( t ) for control strategies that are within 10% of the optimal control strategy â€” specifically, each u n and t n is varied independently by 10% with respect to the optimal values. </caption>
