 <caption> Two-dimensional plots of J ( u 1 , u 2 , t s 1 ) ( cf. Eq.  (20) at fixed t s 1 showing the dependence of J on the controls u 1 and u 2 . A local minimum is shown using a square marker in each panel. Solid line: the state constraint k max t ∈ [ t 0 , T ] I S ( t ) = B . Broken line: the state constraint ( d I S ∕ d t ) t = T = 0 . The closed regions demarcated by the broken lines correspond to the forbidden regions ( d I S ∕ d t ) t = T &gt; 0 ; regions to the left of the solid lines are forbidden also, and correspond to regimes where the constraint k I S ( t ) ≤ B is breached. </caption>
