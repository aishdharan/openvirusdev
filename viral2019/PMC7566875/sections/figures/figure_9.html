 <caption> Plot of k I S ( t ) under an optimal-control strategy in which the boundary is attained. Control parameters: n = 6 , u m a x = 0 . 68 . Cost: J m i n ≈ 146 . 5 . Similar results are found for other values of n , e.g. with n = 12 an eight-peak plot is obtained with J m i n ≈ 129 . 6 . </caption>
