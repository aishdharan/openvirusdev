<p>Chest CT scan usually gives a much better visualization of the lung pneumonia and its spread. Initially, it is diffuse opacities affecting different airways.[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Later on, ground-glass opacities were noticed in mild cases whereas bilateral lung involvement with consolidation was seen in the intensive care unit patients.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Another study in 21 patients revealed, that initial chest CT showed bilateral lung involvement in 86% of patients.[
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Predominantly ground-glass opacity was seen in 58% cases whereas consolidation is seen in 28% cases.[
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The major differences in the chest CT findings between COVID-19 and other epidemics like SARS and MERS, was the bilateral lung involvement in the former as compared to later cases had unilateral involvement [
