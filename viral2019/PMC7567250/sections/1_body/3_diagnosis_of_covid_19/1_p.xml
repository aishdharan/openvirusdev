<p>Various tests have been in place to diagnose COVID-19 with precision. Serological tests usually comprise enzyme-linked immunoassay or in some cases, western blot can also be used. The clinical samples which are taken from the suspected cases are Nasal secretions, oral swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, blood, etc., Pool testing is also being considered as an alternative method for assessing community spread easily and cost-effectively. But as of now, the researchers have shown that the gold standard for identifying the COVID-19 viral particles is real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) which is specific for the viral RNA. Northern blot hybridization, as well as immunofluorescent assay, has also been used to detect viral RNA and other viral antigenic components.[
