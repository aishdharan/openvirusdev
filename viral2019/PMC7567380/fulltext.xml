Shortly thereafter the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the first substantial decline in AIDS deaths [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Health economists determined that by 2003 at least three million life years had been saved in the United States as a direct result of ART [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of HIV-infected persons to prevent the onward transmission of the virus to uninfected persons has been the recommendation of public health officials in the United States since 2012. Viewed from the perspective of public health prevention, this strategy is sometimes referred to as &#x02018;treatment as prevention&#x02019; and has contributed to the announcement of a new initiative by the United States government namely &#x02018;Ending the HIV Epidemic&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A treatment as prevention approach was supported by the early observation that in the island of Taiwan, after ART was provided freely to a population of approximately 4,300 persons with HIV (PWH), the transmission rate of HIV declined [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ample proof of the transmission-blocking potential of ART between sero-discordant couples was later published in 2011 as the chief outcome of a multi-country randomized clinical trial [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Subsequent analysis of this trial showed that almost all transmissions to uninfected partners in this trial occurred from HIV-infected participants whose last index viral load before the estimated date of infection of their uninfected partners exceeded 40,000 copies/mL [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Similar associations between reduced viral load and reduced HIV incidence were observed in British Columbia, Canada, and in the context of a community trial in India. In British Columbia, a population-level longitudinal analysis of province-wide registries showed a 1% decline in HIV incidence for every 1% increase in viral suppression [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The authors concluded that ART expansion between 1996 and 2012 was associated with &#x0201c;a sustained and profound population-level decrease in morbidity, mortality and HIV transmission.&#x0201d; In India, a cluster-randomized trial was conducted among more than 26,000 injection drug users and men who have sex with men (MSM) from 22 communities. These researchers concluded that to reduce HIV incidence by 1%, the viremia in the population would have to be reduced by 4.3% and ART use by PWH would have to increase by 19.5% [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In the United States, a Poisson model using &#x0201c;community viral load&#x0201d; in the city of San Francisco showed that an increase in viral suppression from 45% to 78% was associated with a 46% decline in diagnoses of HIV between 2004 and 2008 [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the impact of viral suppression on incident HIV has not been previously reported for the United States at the state, regional or national levels.</p><p>Over the past decade, jurisdictions have increasingly provided reports of viral load data from persons living with diagnosed HIV and CD4+ lymphocyte counts of newly diagnosed cases to the CDC. The latter has allowed CDC to estimate incident HIV by jurisdiction. In this paper, we examined the impact of viral suppression on estimated incident HIV by jurisdiction in the six-year period from 2010 to 2015.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>The National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) serves as the source for both HIV diagnosis and viral suppression data. CDC estimates and publishes HIV incidence using the reported diagnosis data following the methodology of Song et al. using a CD4 depletion model to estimate time between infection and diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The estimation method also makes use of first reported CD4 cell count after HIV diagnosis, assuming that persons are ART na&#x000ef;ve at the time. Reporting of first CD4 test result after diagnosis is a required element in NHSS and significant progress has been made in reporting of all levels and percentages of CD4 test results [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For this analysis, we used CDC&#x02019;s published HIV incidence estimates among persons 13 years or older (adults and adolescents) for the years 2010 through 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Relative standard errors (RSEs) were previously calculated for estimates of HIV incidence per state. Estimates with an RSE &#x0003e; 50% are considered statistically unreliable and ordinarily not published, and were not included in this analysis. To understand the potential impact of this source of missing data, a sensitivity analysis was done by including these suppressed incidence estimates in the final statistical model to evaluate the change in fitted incidence rates.</p><p>We included 2010&#x02013;2015 state-level demographic variables in the analysis, including percent less than high school graduate, percent Black/African American, percent Hispanic, percent uninsured, and percent below poverty level. These demographic data were extracted from the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Approximately 60% of PWH in the United States are gay, bisexual, or other MSM. We included published estimates of percentage of MSM among adult men for each state [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recent increases in injection drug use in the United States has resulted in growing hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infections in some rural areas. In this study, we also included prevalence of HCV infection by state in the analysis as a proxy for the prevalence of injection drug use using published estimates based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009&#x02013;2013 [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Viral suppression among persons living with HIV (diagnosed and undiagnosed) was extracted from various supplemental surveillance reports published by CDC and is freely available online. The percent virally suppressed was calculated using the following sets of numbers. The numerator was the number of persons with suppressed viral load test results reported to CDC from jurisdictions with complete laboratory reporting of CD4 and viral load test results. Standard surveillance definition of &#x0003c;200 copies/mL at the most recent test result in each year, was used to define viral suppression in a given calendar year. The denominator consisted of estimated total prevalence of HIV for the same year, count of persons living with diagnosed HIV plus estimate of persons living with undiagnosed HIV. The NHSS data is updated regularly. The most recent numerator and denominator data can be accessed from either the HIV surveillance supplemental reports [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. or the National Center for HIV/AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD and Tuberculosis Prevention&#x02019;s AtlasPlus, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/atlas/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/atlas/index.htm</ext-link>. To assess the impact of viral suppression on estimated HIV incidence between 2011 and 2015, a one-year lag in viral suppression was used thereby restricting the viral suppression data in our analysis to the 2010&#x02013;2014 time frame. Although viral suppression data were available for 39 jurisdictions for at least one year, we restricted the analysis to 30 jurisdictions (29 states and the District of Columbia) with data available for 60% (3 years or more) of the time frame to ensure evaluation of changes over time.</p><p>Means and standard deviations were used to summarize percent viral suppression and state level demographic variables by year. Quartiles for estimated HIV incidence rate and percent viral suppression were calculated across the entire time frame, and used to evaluate changes in these measures over time. Estimated annual percent changes (EAPC) in HIV incidence with corresponding fitted yearly rates were determined using Poisson regression models that included a fixed effect for year for each jurisdiction and for all 30 jurisdictions combined. Fitted yearly incidence rates were also determined by region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). Unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios associated with differences in percent viral suppression and demographic characteristics were calculated using multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression models that included a fixed effect for year, and a random intercept to account for within-state correlations. Percent viral suppression and state level demographics were treated as continuous covariates and adjusted models included 2010 estimated HIV incidence rate as a covariate. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 and R version 3.5.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec007"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 30 United States jurisdictions included in the analysis, one third were located in the Midwest and one third were in the South (<xref rid="pone.0240727.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). State specific fitted annual HIV incidence rates showed that 17 of 30 jurisdictions experienced negative estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) between 2010 and 2015 including three of the most populous states: California, New York and Texas (<xref rid="pone.0240727.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In 2010, Washington DC had the highest fitted incidence of any jurisdiction during this period at 149.7 per 100,000 population but also the greatest estimated annual percent decline, -12.7 (95% confidence intervals [CI] -15.0, -10.3). Seven states had positive EAPC with Indiana and Hawaii experiencing the largest increases, 9.1 (95% CI 6.0, 12.3) and 14.0 (95% CI 6.7, 21.8) respectively.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0240727.t001"

For every 1 pp increase in adult men who were MSM, there was a 27% increase in HIV incidence rate (aRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10, 1.48).

This statistical association is consistent with the magnitude of the effects observed in community-randomized trials conducted in India, the SEARCH trial and the PopART trial, as well as the public health experience of British Columbia [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. By scaling the statistics of published data, these studies observed a 2.3%, 6.7%, 5.4% and a 10% decline in HIV incidence rate for every 10 pp increase in viral suppression, respectively. Our ecologic analysis is remarkable considering that the populations of these 30 jurisdictions amount to 64.5% of the United States population in 2010, and are not only diverse in income, race, and ethnicity but are also subject to diverse health insurance contexts.</p><p>By virtue of having the highest incidence of any United States region, Southern states also have the opportunity to make the greatest impact on incident HIV with better viral suppression of PWH. In 2014, Southern states account for an estimated 44% percent of all PWH (diagnosed and undiagnosed) in the United States despite being populated by only a third (37%) of the overall population. Geographically, Southern states are a focus region for the &#x02018;Ending the HIV Epidemic&#x02019; initiative.</p><p>Notable national demographic changes during the six-year period analyzed included a 15.0% decline in the proportion with less than a high school education, an 11.5% decline in the proportion of the United States population below the poverty level and a 36.0% decline in the percentage uninsured, particularly in 2014 and 2015. After adjustment for viral suppression and demographic characteristics, HIV incidence rate was 36% lower in Southern states compared to northeastern states. While health insurance coverage tends to be better in Northeastern states than Southern states [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], an analysis of private health insurance billing data between 2012 and 2013 found that the percentage of persons without an antiretroviral prescription was highest for persons residing in the Northeast region at 30.8% [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This observation suggests a possible link between reduced viral suppression among privately insured diagnosed PWH and HIV incidence in the Northeast.</p><p>In multivariable analysis, state level percent Black race had the strongest association with the estimated HIV incidence rate followed by percent MSM. Blacks/African Americans endure a disproportionate burden of new HIV diagnoses in the United States: in 2017, they accounted for 13% of the United States population but 43% of new HIV diagnoses. This racial disparity in HIV diagnoses has been linked to poverty, substandard education, unstable housing, inadequate health insurance, disproportionate incarceration rates and limited social mobility [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additionally, gay and bisexual men accounted for 67% of all HIV diagnoses in 2016 despite being approximately 4% of the United States male population [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and, of these new diagnoses in MSM, 38% were among Black/African American persons. Rather than geographic region being the explanatory variable, confounding state level demographic variables appear to explain the disproportionate burden of HIV incidence in Northeastern states.</p><p>We observed a trend of overall increases in viral suppression and decreased HIV incidence across the United States. In 2014, the major provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 &#x02013;which included an expansion of Medicaid (the federal insurance program for persons requiring health insurance)&#x02013;came into force. This expansion played a vital role in increasing access to and provision of care and treatment for PWH. However, not all states expanded Medicaid and some essential HIV services and medications were not covered by Medicaid. Typically, these outstanding services (e.g., case management, transportation, pharmacy services) were provided by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP), a federal program established in 1990 to fill gaps in HIV care and treatment for low-income PWH [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. By 2016, the uninsured share of the United States population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20 to 24 million additional people covered. The decline in the uninsured population was captured in our analysis.</p><p>Given this context, one may examine the interplay we observed between HIV incidence, insurance and poverty. While controlling for percent viral suppression, our analysis showed a 10% increase in the HIV incidence rate for every 5 pp increase in the percent of persons living below the national poverty level, but that for every 5 pp increase in the percent of uninsured persons was associated with a 5% decrease in the HIV incidence rate. Superficially, these two observations may appear contradictory because poverty would appear to correlate with lack of insurance. Indeed, nearly half of all PWH in the United States have a household income at or below the federal poverty line and 28.4% of PWH had no insurance [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, a recent analysis of the RWHAP showed that, among recipients, viral suppression increased from 69.5% in 2010 to 85.9% in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The RWHAP could explain the association we observed of a decreased HIV incidence rate among the uninsured. A separate analysis of the period 2009&#x02013;2013 showed that, among 18,095 PWH with and without RWHAP assistance, those who were uninsured and underinsured were more likely to receive ART and be virally suppressed than those with other types of healthcare coverage [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Indiana and West Virginia had increases in incident HIV over time, and were also among the states most impacted by the growing opioid and injection drug use epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We therefore attempted to assess whether injection drug use impacted the relationship between viral suppression and HIV incidence. We included HCV prevalence by jurisdiction in our model as a proxy for injection drug use because HCV infection is strongly associated with injection drug use. We did not observe an association between HCV prevalence and HIV incidence rate after adjusting for relevant demographic characteristics. This observation is consistent with surveillance reports from the same period that show that injection drug use was a relatively low contributor to the annual number of new diagnoses.</p><p>Our analysis has a number of limitations, chief among them being that by 2015 not all states were reporting all viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte test results data. Even some of the 30 jurisdictions in our subset did not have viral suppression data for all years between 2010 and 2015, or had HIV incidence estimates that were statistically unreliable and therefore not included in the analysis. Among the states not included was Florida, which&#x02013;after California and Texas&#x02013;is the third most populous state. Nevertheless, the jurisdictions included in this analysis represent almost two thirds of the United States population. Another limitation is that we used a single measure of viral load to determine who was or was not virally suppressed; however single measures of viral load do not necessarily approximate durable viral suppression [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While some analyses examined the impact of ART coverage on HIV incidence [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a strength of our analysis is the examination of the use of viral suppression to impact HIV incidence rather than ART coverage given the well-known phenomenon of nonadherence to ART [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Finally, our analysis does not account for changes in condom use or the use of pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis (PrEP). The increases of sexually transmitted diseases during this period in the United States&#x02013;to the highest recorded levels&#x02013;appear to confirm that condom use declined during this period [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CDC recommended PrEP in 2014 and by 2016 an estimated 78,000 people had filled a prescription for it [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. By 2016 only 7% of the estimated 1.1 million U.S. persons who had indications for PrEP were prescribed it [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is unlikely that PrEP-related decreases in HIV acquisition would have significantly affected our analysis.</p><p>A key area for improvement in order to more fully realize the strategy of treatment as prevention is recognizing that an estimated 43% of new HIV transmissions were generated by persons who were aware of their HIV infection but were not in care, and 38% of new infections were generated by persons unaware of their status [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, identifying persons with undiagnosed HIV and re-engaging and initiating ART for approximately half a million PWH who were not linked to care or who dropped out of care are vital to successfully prosecuting the &#x02018;Ending the HIV Epidemic&#x02019; campaign in the United States.</p><p>In conclusion, our ecologic analysis suggests that between 2010 and 2015, the increase in viral suppression observed after the rollout of ART was associated with a modest reduction in the United States&#x02019; estimated HIV incidence rate. Initiating and adhering to ART with regimens that include integrase inhibitors and single-tablet triple therapies have made viral suppression easier than ever before. Based upon another ecologic analysis that controlled for viral suppression, PrEP may already have made a contribution towards reducing incident HIV in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our analysis appears to underscore the importance of the RWHAP in helping uninsured and under-insured PWH achieve viral suppression and thereby reduce incident HIV, and that the greatest impact of viral suppression may be effected in Southern states. The &#x02018;Ending the HIV Epidemic&#x02019; announced as a national strategy in 2019 is aimed at intensifying treatment as prevention and PrEP in the 48 counties with the highest burden of HIV in order to reduce national HIV incidence by 90% within 10 years [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This approach applies a lesson learned from results of the recently concluded randomized trials in Africa for treatment as prevention to go &#x0201c;beyond universal testing and treatment to universal testing, treatment and prophylaxis to achieve HIV epidemic control&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0240727.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Disclaimer:</bold> The findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0240727.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r981007.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r981007.htm</ext-link> [Last accessed July 29, 2019]</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0240727.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Walensky</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Paltiel</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Losina</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>

The authors have written a very clear, descriptive, and ecological study with significant contribution to the literature.</p><p>-what is &#x0201c;most recent test in each year&#x0201d;? Recent to each end of year follow-up? Were multiple tests (or even cumulative time suppressed) considered?</p><p>-All the tables are clear; except table 2 I may suggest grouping (instead of alphabetical), but region so it is easier to see variation between states in each region</p><p>-In model, was co-linearity a factor with some of the demographic measures?</p><p>-If space allows, may I suggest a comment on ART coverage and testing rates by state in the discussion</p><p>-solid discussion + limitations section; very thorough; addressed gaps appropriately</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Comments to the authors</p><p>This paper describes the association between state-level viral suppression among HIV-diagnosed individuals and the fittest HIV incidence rate in the following year across the United States. The authors conclude that increased viral suppression is associated with a modest decrease in HIV incidence in the following year, and report declining trends in HIV incidence across most US states during the study period. This paper describes important population-level evidence to support U=U and Treatment as Prevention, and would be of interest to PLOS-ONE readership. The statistical analysis is sound and appropriate, however there are some major limitations in using viral suppression estimates among HIV-diagnosed individuals as a proxy of community-level viraemia, which should be further discussed.</p><p>My overarching concern is that the authors have not accounted for undiagnosed HIV in their analysis. The authors state that viral suppression measures come from data reported to CDC from jurisdictions with complete reporting of HIV viral load tests, so the viral suppression parameter reflects the proportion of *diagnosed* individuals who are virally suppressed. However, the more proximal variable related to HIV incidence would be state-level viraemia, i.e. the proportion of the *entire population* which have detectable HIV. Therefore, large difference in rates of undiagnosed HIV across states / over time may bias results. Are there any estimates of HIV prevalence / rate of undiagnosed HIV in each state which could be used in conjunction with viral suppression rates among those diagnosed to estimate community-level viremia? If this is not possible this should be discussed in the limitations, or the authors should elaborate on the rationale for using viral suppression among those diagnosed as the driver of HIV incidence.</p><p>Lines 89-92. The authors state that HIV incidence is estimated using first reported CD4 cell count after HIV diagnosis and a CD4 depletion model. It would be prudent to elaborate on the methods of this model, and the parameters used. Two citations are given, however it is my understanding that each of the paper cited use slightly different methods / parameters in the depletion model. Can the authors provide the model specs or formulae in supplementary materials?</p><p>Line112. Can the authors provide a justification for using a 1-year lag period?</p><p>Lines 118-119: &#x0201c;Quartiles for estimated HIV incidence rate and percent viral suppression were calculated across the entire time frame&#x0201d;.. do you mean they were calculated for each state for each year? The results &#x0201c;Most states did not experience changes to a lower quartile&#x0201d; suggests this is the case. If so please clarify.. &#x0201c;Annual quartiles for&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Table 3 please add p-values</p><p>Line 193-195: &#x0201c;The impact on HIV incidence rate in Southern states diminished after adjustment for viral suppression and demographic characteristics to being 36% lower compared with the Northeastern states.&#x0201d; This statement is slightly confusing, the impact of what? Suggest changing to something such as &#x0201c;After adjustment for viral suppression and demographic characteristics, HIV incidence rate was 36% lower in Southern states compared to northeastern states&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;The relative difference in HIV incidence in Southern states compared to Northeasterns states diminished after.&#x0201d;</p><p>Lines 251-252. &#x0201c;The increases of sexually transmitted diseases during this period in the United States &#x02013; to the highest recorded levels &#x02013; suggest that condom use did not increase.29&#x0201d; I think a citation here to actual data on condom use would be more suitable.</p><p>Line 264 &#x0201c;In conclusion, our ecologic analysis suggests that between 2010 and 2015, the increase in viral suppression observed after the rollout of ART modestly reduced the estimated HIV incidence rate in the United States.&#x0201d; Given the limitations mentioned and the ecological nature of this study, authors should avoid causal terms, eg reduced.

The authors have written a very clear, descriptive, and ecological study with significant contribution to the literature.</p><p>AUTHORS: Thank you.</p><p>-what is &#x0201c;most recent test in each year&#x0201d;? Recent to each end of year follow-up? Were multiple tests (or even cumulative time suppressed) considered?</p><p>AUTHORS: The most recent test in each year is the last recorded viral load test result within the given calendar year. Multiple tests were not considered, only the last recorded viral load test. Cumulative time suppressed was not considered.</p><p>-All the tables are clear; except table 2 I may suggest grouping (instead of alphabetical), but region so it is easier to see variation between states in each region</p><p>AUTHORS: This change has been made to Table 2.</p><p>-In model, was co-linearity a factor with some of the demographic measures?</p><p>AUTHORS: Yes, multicollinearity in the model was a concern since the demographic measures are correlated. However, the estimated rate ratios and precision estimates were similar between unadjusted and adjusted models, indicating validity of the estimated associations was likely not impacted by these correlations.</p><p>-If space allows, may I suggest a comment on ART coverage and testing rates by state in the discussion</p><p>AUTHORS: Although we reference several articles that studied the impact of ART coverage on HIV incidence (e.g., Montaner PLoS One 2014), we chose to examine the impact of viral suppression on HIV incidence given the well-known phenomenon of non-adherence to ART (Durham Int J STD AIDS 2018, Mills JAMA 2006, Wohl JAIDS 2017). Viral suppression is more proximal to incident HIV and if not achieved will lead to transmission of the virus (Cohen NEJM 2016, Table 2). We have added a sentence to highlight this strength of our analysis in the Discussion. Regarding testing rates, we believe Reviewer #1 is alluding to the concern with underdiagnosis of HIV in the US. We address this in a question raised by Reviewer #2 below and have modified a sentence in the Methods to more explicitly address this concern.</p><p>-solid discussion + limitations section; very thorough; addressed gaps appropriately</p><p>AUTHORS: Thank you.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Comments to the authors</p><p>This paper describes the association between state-level viral suppression among HIV-diagnosed individuals and the fittest HIV incidence rate in the following year across the United States. The authors conclude that increased viral suppression is associated with a modest decrease in HIV incidence in the following year, and report declining trends in HIV incidence across most US states during the study period. This paper describes important population-level evidence to support U=U and Treatment as Prevention, and would be of interest to PLOS-ONE readership. The statistical analysis is sound and appropriate, however there are some major limitations in using viral suppression estimates among HIV-diagnosed individuals as a proxy of community-level viraemia, which should be further discussed.</p><p>My overarching concern is that the authors have not accounted for undiagnosed HIV in their analysis. The authors state that viral suppression measures come from data reported to CDC from jurisdictions with complete reporting of HIV viral load tests, so the viral suppression parameter reflects the proportion of *diagnosed* individuals who are virally suppressed. However, the more proximal variable related to HIV incidence would be state-level viraemia, i.e. the proportion of the *entire population* which have detectable HIV. Therefore, large difference in rates of undiagnosed HIV across states / over time may bias results. Are there any estimates of HIV prevalence / rate of undiagnosed HIV in each state which could be used in conjunction with viral suppression rates among those diagnosed to estimate community-level viremia? If this is not possible this should be discussed in the limitations, or the authors should elaborate on the rationale for using viral suppression among those diagnosed as the driver of HIV incidence.</p><p>AUTHORS: The proportion of PWH virally suppressed for each state was calculated using all persons living with HIV (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) as the denominator, so undiagnosed HIV is accounted for in the calculation of this variable. Our methodology and source data are now more explicitly described in the revised manuscript. </p><p>Additionally, as an alternative, we had repeated the multivariable analysis to include the proportion of diagnosed HIV as a separate state-level variable in the model and the proportion of viral suppression was calculated only for those with diagnosed HIV. The results were similar, with the exception that the effect of region diminished after adjustment for the proportion with diagnosed HIV. These results are included below for comparison.</p><p>Unadjusted and adjusted associations of viral suppression (among only those diagnosed with HIV) and demographic variables with HIV incidence</p><p> Unadjusted Rate Ratio (95% CI)* Adjusted Rate Ratio (95% CI)**</p><p>Viral Suppression (%) in Previous Year</p><p>(per increase of 10%) 1.01 (0.98, 1.04) 0.95 (0.92, 0.98)</p><p>Percent Diagnosed with HIV in Previous Year</p><p>(per increase of 10%) 1.09 (1.05, 1.14) 1.08 (1.03, 1.14)</p><p>Percent &#x0003c; High School Graduate</p><p>(per increase of 5%) 1.07 (0.95, 1.21) 1.18 (1.03, 1.35)</p><p>Percent Black</p><p>(per increase of 5%) 1.34 (1.27, 1.42) 1.36 (1.27, 1.46)</p><p>Percent Hispanic</p><p>(per increase of 5%) 1.04 (0.89, 1.21) 1.09 (1.03, 1.15)</p><p>Percent Uninsured </p><p>(per increase of 5%) 0.93 (0.91, 0.95) 0.94 (0.91, 0.96)</p><p>Percent Below Poverty Level</p><p>(per increase of 5%) 1.05 (1.02, 1.08) 1.10 (1.06, 1.13)</p><p>Percent MSM 2009-13</p><p>(per increase of 1%) 1.22 (1.12, 1.33) 1.15 (1.01, 1.30)</p><p>Prevalence of HCV Infection 2013-16</p><p>(per increase of 1%) 2.83 (1.58, 5.09) 0.99 (0.73, 1.35)</p><p>Region </p><p> Northeast 1.0 1.0</p><p> Midwest 0.90 (0.38, 2.11) 0.92 (0.68, 1.24)</p><p> South 2.48 (1.08, 5.69) 0.81 (0.56, 1.15)</p><p> West 1.05 (0.42, 2.63) 1.00 (0.72, 1.39)</p><p>* Results determined using a multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression models including the variable of interest, a fixed effect for year, and a random intercept.</p><p>** Results determined using a multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression model including all variables in the table, fixed effects for year and 2010 HIV incidence rate, and a random intercept.</p><p>Lines 89-92. The authors state that HIV incidence is estimated using first reported CD4 cell count after HIV diagnosis and a CD4 depletion model. It would be prudent to elaborate on the methods of this model, and the parameters used. Two citations are given, however it is my understanding that each of the paper cited use slightly different methods / parameters in the depletion model. Can the authors provide the model specs or formulae in supplementary materials?</p><p>AUTHORS: It is beyond the scope of this paper to elaborate the methods of previously published models which our team did not design. While two citations reference the methods, we agree with Reviewer 2 that there is some ambiguity as to the source of the HIV incidence data by state. We have added a reference and modified the Methods section to read as follows: &#x0201c;The National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) serves as the source for both HIV diagnosis and viral suppression data. CDC estimates and publishes HIV incidence using the reported diagnosis data following the methodology of Song et al. using a CD4 depletion model to estimate time between infection and diagnosis. The estimation method also makes use of first reported CD4 cell count after HIV diagnosis, assuming that persons were ART na&#x000ef;ve at the time. Reporting of first CD4 test result after diagnosis is a required element in NHSS and significant progress has been made in reporting of all levels and percentages of CD4 test results. For this analysis, we used CDC&#x02019;s published HIV incidence estimates among persons 13 years or older (adults and adolescents) during 2010 through 2015.&#x0201d; </p><p>Line112. Can the authors provide a justification for using a 1-year lag period?</p><p>AUTHORS: The 1-year lag period was used to most accurately assess the impact of viral suppression on HIV incidence, since viral suppression was defined using the most recent test result in a given year which could often be late in the calendar year. Without a 1-year lag, we would have assumed that all virally suppressed PWH would have been suppressed at the beginning of the year to impact HIV incidence in the same year which seems implausible.</p><p>Lines 118-119: &#x0201c;Quartiles for estimated HIV incidence rate and percent viral suppression were calculated across the entire time frame&#x0201d;.. do you mean they were calculated for each state for each year? The results &#x0201c;Most states did not experience changes to a lower quartile&#x0201d; suggests this is the case. If so please clarify.. &#x0201c;Annual quartiles for&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>AUTHORS: To assess trends in viral suppression and HIV incidence over time, quartiles were calculated using all data points from 2010-15, not separately for each year. In the methods we state &#x0201c;Quartiles &#x02026; were calculated across the entire time frame.&#x0201d;</p><p>Table 3 please add p-values</p><p>AUTHORS: P-values have been added to Table 3.</p><p>Line 193-195: &#x0201c;The impact on HIV incidence rate in Southern states diminished after adjustment for viral suppression and demographic characteristics to being 36% lower compared with the Northeastern states.&#x0201d; This statement is slightly confusing, the impact of what? Suggest changing to something such as &#x0201c;After adjustment for viral suppression and demographic characteristics, HIV incidence rate was 36% lower in Southern states compared to northeastern states&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;The relative difference in HIV incidence in Southern states compared to Northeasterns states diminished after.&#x0201d;</p><p>AUTHORS: We agree with Reviewer 2 and have modified the sentence.</p><p>Lines 251-252. &#x0201c;The increases of sexually transmitted diseases during this period in the United States &#x02013; to the highest recorded levels &#x02013; suggest that condom use did not increase.29&#x0201d; I think a citation here to actual data on condom use would be more suitable.</p><p>AUTHORS: We have now provided two references to support this suggestion of a decline in condom use during this period: Paz-Bailey et al. AIDS 2016 found that in the 2005, 2008, 2011, and 2014 cycles of National HIV Behavioral Surveillance: &#x0201c;Among 5371 HIV-positive MSM, there were increases in concordant (19% in 2005 to 25% in 2014, P&#x0003c;0.001) and discordant condomless sex (15 to 19%,P &#x0003c; 0.001). The increases were not different by ART use.&#x0201d; Also, Harper et al. Sex Transm Dis. 2018 who reported that in the 2003&#x02013;2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys: &#x0201c;Between 2003 and 2015, significant declines in self-reported condom use were observed among black female (63.6% in 2003 to 46.7% in 2015) and white male students (69.0% in 2003 to 58.1% in 2015).&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 264 &#x0201c;In conclusion, our ecologic analysis suggests that between 2010 and 2015, the increase in viral suppression observed after the rollout of ART modestly reduced the estimated HIV incidence rate in the United States.&#x0201d; Given the limitations mentioned and the ecological nature of this study, authors should avoid causal terms, eg reduced. Consider &#x0201c;was associated with a reduction in&#x0201d;.</p><p>AUTHORS: We agree and the sentence has been modified.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0240727.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0240727.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0240727.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0240727.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hearps</surname><given-names>Anna C</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Anna C Hearps</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Anna C Hearps</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0240727" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
