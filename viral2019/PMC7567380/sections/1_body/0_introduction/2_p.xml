<p>Treatment of HIV-infected persons to prevent the onward transmission of the virus to uninfected persons has been the recommendation of public health officials in the United States since 2012. Viewed from the perspective of public health prevention, this strategy is sometimes referred to as ‘treatment as prevention’ and has contributed to the announcement of a new initiative by the United States government namely ‘Ending the HIV Epidemic’ [

Subsequent analysis of this trial showed that almost all transmissions to uninfected partners in this trial occurred from HIV-infected participants whose last index viral load before the estimated date of infection of their uninfected partners exceeded 40,000 copies/mL [
