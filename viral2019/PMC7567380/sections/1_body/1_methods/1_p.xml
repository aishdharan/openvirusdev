 <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The estimation method also makes use of first reported CD4 cell count after HIV diagnosis, assuming that persons are ART naïve at the time. Reporting of first CD4 test result after diagnosis is a required element in NHSS and significant progress has been made in reporting of all levels and percentages of CD4 test results [
 <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For this analysis, we used CDC’s published HIV incidence estimates among persons 13 years or older (adults and adolescents) for the years 2010 through 2015 [
