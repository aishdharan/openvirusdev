<p>Viral suppression among persons living with HIV (diagnosed and undiagnosed) was extracted from various supplemental surveillance reports published by CDC and is freely available online. The percent virally suppressed was calculated using the following sets of numbers. The numerator was the number of persons with suppressed viral load test results reported to CDC from jurisdictions with complete laboratory reporting of CD4 and viral load test results. Standard surveillance definition of &lt;200 copies/mL at the most recent test result in each year, was used to define viral suppression in a given calendar year. The denominator consisted of estimated total prevalence of HIV for the same year, count of persons living with diagnosed HIV plus estimate of persons living with undiagnosed HIV. The NHSS data is updated regularly. The most recent numerator and denominator data can be accessed from either the HIV surveillance supplemental reports [

To assess the impact of viral suppression on estimated HIV incidence between 2011 and 2015, a one-year lag in viral suppression was used thereby restricting the viral suppression data in our analysis to the 2010–2014 time frame. Although viral suppression data were available for 39 jurisdictions for at least one year, we restricted the analysis to 30 jurisdictions (29 states and the District of Columbia) with data available for 60% (3 years or more) of the time frame to ensure evaluation of changes over time.
