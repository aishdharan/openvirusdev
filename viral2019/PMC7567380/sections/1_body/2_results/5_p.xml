<p>In the multivariable model, we found a 4% decline in estimated HIV incidence rate for every 10 percentage point (pp) increase in viral suppression (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93, 0.99, 
 <xref rid="pone.0240727.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). While adjusting for viral suppression and relevant state level demographic characteristics, every 5 pp increase in the proportion of persons with less than a high school education, of Black race and below the poverty line, higher HIV incidence rates were observed: (aRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04, 1.38; aRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.31, 1.54; aRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.07, 1.14; respectively). For every 1 pp increase in adult men who were MSM, there was a 27% increase in HIV incidence rate (aRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10, 1.48). We found a 5% (aRR 0.95; 95% CI 0.92, 0.97) decline in HIV incidence rate for every 5 pp increase in percent uninsured.
