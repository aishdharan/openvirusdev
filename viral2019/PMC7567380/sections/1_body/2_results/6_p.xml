<p>The largest impact of viral suppression after adjusting for relevant state level demographic characteristics was found in the Southern states: aRR 0.64 (95% CI 0.42, 0.99) as compared with the Northeastern states (
 <xref rid="pone.0240727.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Impacts were slightly less in the Midwest: aRR 0.70 (95% CI 0.50, 0.99) and the West: aRR 0.72 (95% CI 0.49, 1.06). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240727.g003">Fig 3</xref> suggests that if percent viral suppression increased from 30% to 50%, the fitted incidence would decrease from 18.8 to 17.3 per 100,000 in the Northeast in 2015, while it would decrease from 12.1 to 11.1 per 100,000 in the South.
