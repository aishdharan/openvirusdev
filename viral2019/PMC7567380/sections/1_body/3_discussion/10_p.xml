<p>In conclusion, our ecologic analysis suggests that between 2010 and 2015, the increase in viral suppression observed after the rollout of ART was associated with a modest reduction in the United States’ estimated HIV incidence rate. Initiating and adhering to ART with regimens that include integrase inhibitors and single-tablet triple therapies have made viral suppression easier than ever before. Based upon another ecologic analysis that controlled for viral suppression, PrEP may already have made a contribution towards reducing incident HIV in the United States [

Our analysis appears to underscore the importance of the RWHAP in helping uninsured and under-insured PWH achieve viral suppression and thereby reduce incident HIV, and that the greatest impact of viral suppression may be effected in Southern states. The ‘Ending the HIV Epidemic’ announced as a national strategy in 2019 is aimed at intensifying treatment as prevention and PrEP in the 48 counties with the highest burden of HIV in order to reduce national HIV incidence by 90% within 10 years [

This approach applies a lesson learned from results of the recently concluded randomized trials in Africa for treatment as prevention to go “beyond universal testing and treatment to universal testing, treatment and prophylaxis to achieve HIV epidemic control” [
