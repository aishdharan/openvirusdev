<p>We observed that between 2010 and 2015 among 29 states and the District of Columbia every 10 pp increase in viral suppression during the previous year was associated with an adjusted 4% decline in the estimated incidence rate of HIV in the subsequent year. This statistical association is consistent with the magnitude of the effects observed in community-randomized trials conducted in India, the SEARCH trial and the PopART trial, as well as the public health experience of British Columbia [

By scaling the statistics of published data, these studies observed a 2.3%, 6.7%, 5.4% and a 10% decline in HIV incidence rate for every 10 pp increase in viral suppression, respectively. Our ecologic analysis is remarkable considering that the populations of these 30 jurisdictions amount to 64.5% of the United States population in 2010, and are not only diverse in income, race, and ethnicity but are also subject to diverse health insurance contexts.
