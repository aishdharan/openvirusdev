<p>In multivariable analysis, state level percent Black race had the strongest association with the estimated HIV incidence rate followed by percent MSM.

Rather than geographic region being the explanatory variable, confounding state level demographic variables appear to explain the disproportionate burden of HIV incidence in Northeastern states.
