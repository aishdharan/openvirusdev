<p>Given this context, one may examine the interplay we observed between HIV incidence, insurance and poverty. While controlling for percent viral suppression, our analysis showed a 10% increase in the HIV incidence rate for every 5 pp increase in the percent of persons living below the national poverty level, but that for every 5 pp increase in the percent of uninsured persons was associated with a 5% decrease in the HIV incidence rate. Superficially, these two observations may appear contradictory because poverty would appear to correlate with lack of insurance. Indeed, nearly half of all PWH in the United States have a household income at or below the federal poverty line and 28.4% of PWH had no insurance [

A separate analysis of the period 2009â€“2013 showed that, among 18,095 PWH with and without RWHAP assistance, those who were uninsured and underinsured were more likely to receive ART and be virally suppressed than those with other types of healthcare coverage [
