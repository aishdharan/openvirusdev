<p>Indiana and West Virginia had increases in incident HIV over time, and were also among the states most impacted by the growing opioid and injection drug use epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We therefore attempted to assess whether injection drug use impacted the relationship between viral suppression and HIV incidence. We included HCV prevalence by jurisdiction in our model as a proxy for injection drug use because HCV infection is strongly associated with injection drug use. We did not observe an association between HCV prevalence and HIV incidence rate after adjusting for relevant demographic characteristics. This observation is consistent with surveillance reports from the same period that show that injection drug use was a relatively low contributor to the annual number of new diagnoses.
