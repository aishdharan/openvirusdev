<p>Our analysis has a number of limitations, chief among them being that by 2015 not all states were reporting all viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte test results data. Even some of the 30 jurisdictions in our subset did not have viral suppression data for all years between 2010 and 2015, or had HIV incidence estimates that were statistically unreliable and therefore not included in the analysis. Among the states not included was Florida, which–after California and Texas–is the third most populous state. Nevertheless, the jurisdictions included in this analysis represent almost two thirds of the United States population. Another limitation is that we used a single measure of viral load to determine who was or was not virally suppressed; however single measures of viral load do not necessarily approximate durable viral suppression [

 <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a strength of our analysis is the examination of the use of viral suppression to impact HIV incidence rather than ART coverage given the well-known phenomenon of nonadherence to ART [

The increases of sexually transmitted diseases during this period in the United States–to the highest recorded levels–appear to confirm that condom use declined during this period [
