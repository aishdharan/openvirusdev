<p>Lines 89-92. The authors state that HIV incidence is estimated using first reported CD4 cell count after HIV diagnosis and a CD4 depletion model. It would be prudent to elaborate on the methods of this model, and the parameters used. Two citations are given, however it is my understanding that each of the paper cited use slightly different methods / parameters in the depletion model. Can the authors provide the model specs or formulae in supplementary materials?</p>
