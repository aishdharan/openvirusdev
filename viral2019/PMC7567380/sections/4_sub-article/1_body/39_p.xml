<p>AUTHORS: Although we reference several articles that studied the impact of ART coverage on HIV incidence (e.g., Montaner PLoS One 2014), we chose to examine the impact of viral suppression on HIV incidence given the well-known phenomenon of non-adherence to ART (Durham Int J STD AIDS 2018, Mills JAMA 2006, Wohl JAIDS 2017). Viral suppression is more proximal to incident HIV and if not achieved will lead to transmission of the virus (Cohen NEJM 2016, Table 2). We have added a sentence to highlight this strength of our analysis in the Discussion. Regarding testing rates, we believe Reviewer #1 is alluding to the concern with underdiagnosis of HIV in the US. We address this in a question raised by Reviewer #2 below and have modified a sentence in the Methods to more explicitly address this concern.</p>
