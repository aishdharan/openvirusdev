<p>AUTHORS: The 1-year lag period was used to most accurately assess the impact of viral suppression on HIV incidence, since viral suppression was defined using the most recent test result in a given year which could often be late in the calendar year. Without a 1-year lag, we would have assumed that all virally suppressed PWH would have been suppressed at the beginning of the year to impact HIV incidence in the same year which seems implausible.</p>
