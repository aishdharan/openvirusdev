<p>AUTHORS: We have now provided two references to support this suggestion of a decline in condom use during this period: Paz-Bailey et al. AIDS 2016 found that in the 2005, 2008, 2011, and 2014 cycles of National HIV Behavioral Surveillance: “Among 5371 HIV-positive MSM, there were increases in concordant (19% in 2005 to 25% in 2014, P&lt;0.001) and discordant condomless sex (15 to 19%,P &lt; 0.001). The increases were not different by ART use.” Also, Harper et al. Sex Transm Dis. 2018 who reported that in the 2003–2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys: “Between 2003 and 2015, significant declines in self-reported condom use were observed among black female (63.6% in 2003 to 46.7% in 2015) and white male students (69.0% in 2003 to 58.1% in 2015).”</p>
