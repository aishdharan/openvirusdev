<p>Broadly speaking, two distinct approaches to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have received much attention. The first aims to suppress transmission in the target population (referred to hereafter as “suppression”) (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Under this objective, control measures reduce viral transmission to such a degree that sustained endogenous transmission is no longer possible. By maintaining control measures in place for a sufficient period of time, the virus will be eliminated in the focal population. The focus will then shift to preventing subsequent reintroduction to prevent resurgence. The second approach aims to manage or mitigate the negative health impacts (referred to hereafter as “mitigation”) (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). While suppression aims to ultimately halt local transmission, mitigation aims to reduce the growth rate of the epidemic to ensure disease burden does not overwhelm healthcare systems (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). By reducing (rather than halting) transmission, this strategy allows the susceptible pool to diminish, with the population potentially able to achieve herd immunity (whereby sustained local transmission is impossible, even without social distancing) (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In practice, both approaches require the rollout of the same types of control measures (social distancing and self-isolation), although the necessary intensities and durations vary.
