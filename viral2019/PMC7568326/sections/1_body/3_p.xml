<p>The consequences of failure to either adequately mitigate or suppress COVID-19 are potentially catastrophic. Due to the many uncertainties surrounding SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution, and immunity, public health decision makers are presented with an unenviable task. To help inform control policies under uncertainty, mathematical modeling can assist in evaluating the viability of mitigation and suppression as objectives (
