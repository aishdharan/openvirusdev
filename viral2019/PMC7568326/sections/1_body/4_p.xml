<p>Recent studies have modeled impacts of both mitigation and suppression strategies, including for China (

 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Crucially, we are not aware of any systematic studies that focus on 1) walking the tightrope of achieving herd immunity without overburdening healthcare systems and 2) the control effort (e.g., reduction in contacts) required for successful mitigation relative to suppression. These two knowledge gaps motivate our study. We use an age-stratified disease transmission model, taking the United Kingdom as an example, to simulate SARS-CoV-2 spread controlled by individual self-isolation and widespread social distancing. We simulated various levels of self-isolation effectiveness and three distinct types of social-distancing measures: 1) school (including university) closures, 2) work and social place closures, and 3) effective isolation by older individuals.
