<p>Our modeling required estimates for the case hospitalization probability (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and mean hospitalization stay (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We explored sensitivity of the duration of social distancing to these two parameters, and also performed a comparison with a rough calculation of the duration based on estimates of seroprevalance at the end of April (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) (
