<p>The addition of school (and university) closures, corresponding to a 70% reduction in contacts among school-aged individuals and a 20% reduction with 25- to 59-y-olds, dramatically reduces the rate of epidemic growth (

  <italic>G</italic>
 </xref>), although such levels of control are insufficient to suppress the epidemic (i.e., the number of daily cases still rises after implementation). The premature reopening of schools after 100 d (while the virus is still circulating) triggers a second wave of infection, with only a moderately reduced peak in daily new cases, largely eroding any additional gains made (

 </xref>) and the number of fatalities (

 </xref>) are largely unaltered compared to if schools had not been closed (compare
