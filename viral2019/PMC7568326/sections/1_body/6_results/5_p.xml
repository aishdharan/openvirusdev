<p>The time taken for suppression to be achieved (modeled as a 100-fold reduction in infectious individuals) once control measures are implemented is shown in

 </xref>. If self-isolation effectiveness is high (
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="i6">
   <mo>&gt;</mo>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>70% reduction in transmission), then suppression can be achieved in 2 mo regardless of any additional social distancing measures. There is little additional decrease in the necessary duration of social distancing unless schools and workplaces are both closed, in which case suppression can be achieved within 2 mo at much lower levels of self-isolation effectiveness (
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="i7">
   <mo>â‰³</mo>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>45%).
