<p>These results are also mirrored in the impacts of social distancing on the daily cases in 60+-y-old individuals (

 </xref>; compare to

 </xref>). If social distancing is applied to all age groups, this range is 0 to 14% self-isolation effectiveness, whereas, if just the 60+-y age group socially distance, the range is 41 to 54%.
