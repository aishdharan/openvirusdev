<p>A major unknown remains the nature, duration, and effectiveness of natural immunity. Here, we made the pragmatic assumption that, over the time scales under consideration, infection confers perfect long-lasting immunity (the best-case scenario for mitigation strategies). If immunity is not perfect, and there is a moderate to high chance of reinfection, then prospects for achieving herd immunity via natural infection are slim (

 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), provide a powerful means of integrating parallel serological and epidemiological data streams to quantify population-level immunity. Further, such models can be central to the development of efficient age-stratified serological testing schemes.
