Due to differences in the final age group of our model (70+ y) and those of the Wuhan study (70- to 79-y-olds and 80+-y-olds), the hospitalization and fatality rates for 70+-y-old individuals were calculated by summing the estimated 70- to 79-y-old and 80+-y-old rates weighted by their relative UK population sizes. Based on data from the United Kingdom, we assumed the average duration of hospitalization with COVID-19,
