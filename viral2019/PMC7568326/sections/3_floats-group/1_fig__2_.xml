  <p>Prospects for disease suppression. Simulations of the age-structured SEIR model performed assuming control measures are initiated when there is a total of 10,000 infectious individuals in the population. The different control measures and strengths are listed in

   <italic>A</italic>) Whether suppression is possible depends on both the self-isolation observance rate and the proportion of infections due to symptomatic individuals. More extensive social distancing measures increase the ranges of these two parameters for which suppression is possible. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Increases in self-isolation effectiveness drive down the reproductive number, which also depends on the social distancing measures employed. (
   <italic>C</italic>) The time taken for COVID-19 to be suppressed (modeled as a 100-fold reduction in infectious individuals) depends on the amount the reproductive number is decreased below one.
