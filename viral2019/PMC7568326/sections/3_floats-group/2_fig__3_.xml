 <caption>
  <p>Outcomes of disease mitigation attempts, simulated using the age-structured SEIR model. As in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, control measures are implemented when there are 10,000 cases in the population. (
   <italic>A</italic>) The final fraction of 60+-y-old individuals exposed to COVID-19 for each of the control strategies simulated, assuming that social distancing measures can be maintained at the same strength indefinitely (“without fatigue”). (
   <italic>B</italic>) Size and (
   <italic>C</italic>) timing of the peak in daily new cases among 60+-y-old individuals. (
   <italic>D</italic>) Peak hospital burden, assuming age-specific hospitalization rates (see 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">
    <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>
   </xref>) and a mean hospital stay of 7 d (
   <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). (
   <italic>E</italic>–
   <italic>H</italic>) Simulation results using the same control strategies as in 
   <italic>A</italic>–
   <italic>D</italic>, but assuming that, due to fatigue, schools and workplaces closures last 100 d.
