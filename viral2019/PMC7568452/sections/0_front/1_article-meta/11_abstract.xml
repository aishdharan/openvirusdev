 <p>The re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its associated neonatal microcephaly and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome have led the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency. Until today, many related studies have successively reported the role of various viral proteins of ZIKV in the process of ZIKV infection and pathogenicity. These studies have provided significant insights for the treatment and prevention of ZIKV infection. Here we review the current research advances in the functional characterization of the interactions between each ZIKV viral protein and its host factors.</p>
