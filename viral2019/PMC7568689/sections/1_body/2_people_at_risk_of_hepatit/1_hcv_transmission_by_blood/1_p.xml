<p id="Par28">HCV transmission has considerably changed, reflecting both the evolution of medicine, in particular the cloning of the HCV, and health and social changes. The main modes of HCV transmission are parenteral exposure, unapparent parenteral transmission and occupational exposure. Blood transfusion was the main risk factor for HCV infection before donor screening for surrogate marker testing for non-A and non-B hepatitis which began in the mid-1980s, followed by screening for antibodies to HCV in 1990 [

However, given that anti-HCV antibodies are not detectable for several weeks or months in recently infected donors’ blood, in some countries, all donations are tested by nucleic acid amplification tests for the presence of HCV RNA. The WHO reports that 39 countries do not routinely screen blood transfusions for blood-borne viruses [
