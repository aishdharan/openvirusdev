<p id="Par34">In a recent review, Joy et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] divulge the early HCV epidemic dynamics in North America. In particular, they demonstrate that the expansion of genotype 1a before 1965 suggests that nosocomial or iatrogenic factors rather than past sporadic behavioural risk (such as experimentation with injection drug use, unsafe tattooing, high-risk sex) were key contributors to the HCV epidemic in North America. These results, therefore, suggest to increase rates of HCV screening and treatment and reduce stigmatisation around HCV screening and diagnosis.
