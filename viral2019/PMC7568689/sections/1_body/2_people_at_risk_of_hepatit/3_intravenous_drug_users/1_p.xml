<p id="Par36">HCV infection is very common in people who inject drugs, in whom HIV co-infection is very common. Injection drug use is the main risk factor for HCV transmission in both Europe and the USA. A recent systematic review has been conducted to estimate the prevalence of anti-HCV among PWID, identifying 77 eligible countries out of 152 countries considered, corresponding to about 82% of the estimated world population of PWID [

The results of this review showed that the prevalence of HCV infection in drug users exceeded 80% in 12 countries including Italy, was between 60 and 80% in 25 countries including the USA and Asia, was between 40 and 80% in 24 countries including Australia and Britain and was less than 40% in 16 countries, including Turkey. The data were not available for 74 countries. The number of new cases of HCV declined precipitously between 1990 and 2005.
