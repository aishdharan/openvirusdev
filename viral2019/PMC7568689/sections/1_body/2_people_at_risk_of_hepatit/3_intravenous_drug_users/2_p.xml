<p id="Par37">Currently, PWID represent the majority of people with HCV in many countries throughout the world. New cases of HCV have increased threefold between 2005 and 2015. Approximately 50% of PWID have been exposed to HCV, and 25% of these people are under the age of 25. However, PWID access health care and receive HCV treatment at much lower rates than baby boomers. There are many reasons for this, such as no other medical disorders associated with HCV that require medical care, and a higher rate of mental health issues, which is why physicians consider PWID to be non-compliant.</p>
