<p id="Par38">This route of transmission is possible in HCV patients, but less frequent than in HBV patients (about 1%). The incidence rate of HCV transmission of 0.37 per 1000 person-years was observed in monogamous couples during a follow-up period of 10 years [

People with HIV are at high risk of HCV infection. HCV/HIV co-infection is common, the prevalence of which is between 9 and 37.3% and is probably due to the common route of transmission of these infections [
