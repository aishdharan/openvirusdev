<p id="Par41">Worldwide, about 30% of HIV-infected people are HCV or HBV co-infected. Generally, HIV/HCV co-infection is more common in individuals who have a history of injection drug use. Several studies have also shown that these co-infections are at major risk of liver fibrosis progression with consequent evolution to cirrhosis. HIV-infected individuals are at risk of contracting viral hepatitis. In Tuscany, in 5 years of monitoring, it has been seen that co-infected patients showed a prevalence of 7.8%, of whom 91.5% were Italian [

HCV patients did not show a particular association with advanced HIV disease, possibly because the tests were performed earlier. The reasons associated with testing were mainly related to the perception of risk, or the test was carried out because it was offered by Drug Addiction Services or offered in prison. Therefore, these data do not represent a random sample of the whole sub-population. These data show a higher prevalence of HCV infection in HIV-positive foreigners than in Italians. Moreover, HIV/HBV co-infected patients were at higher risk of being a late presenter, having advanced HIV disease and AIDS. The prevalence of HIV/HCV is high in injection drug users and the age group 35–59 years. This also confirms the finding of a less-advanced stage of the disease in these patients, reasonably due to a greater perception of risk of disease that could lead to earlier testing [
