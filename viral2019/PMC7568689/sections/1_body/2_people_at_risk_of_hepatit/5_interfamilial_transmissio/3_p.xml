<p id="Par44">As outlined by Indolfi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], the limits of several studies on horizontal transmission are due to limited phylogenetic analyses, demonstrating that different individuals of the same family or household are infected with viruses with very similar genomic sequences. The virological confirmation that a horizontal transmission event has occurred is supported by a high rate of sequence homology found between the HCV genome of infected patients and the HCV genome of their infected contacts. Moreover, interfamilial HCV transmission is called into question for both non-sexual transmission mediated by close contact with infected domestic objects and sexual transmission. It is for this reason that the prevalence reported in several studies is extremely variable [
