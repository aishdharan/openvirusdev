 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] recently carried out a population-based, cross-sectional study from July 2015 to April 2017 with the aim of determining the prevalence of HCV and assessing the cost-effectiveness of a screen-and-treat strategy in the Spanish population. A total of 12,246 participants aged 20–74 (58.4% females) were enrolled in this study. The results showed that the prevalence of anti-HCV was 1.2%, whereas the prevalence of detectable HCV RNA was 0.3%, highlighting a misalignment between anti-HCV prevalence and viraemia and a greater awareness of HCV status than previously assumed. The highest prevalence of anti-HCV (1.6%) and of HCV RNA positivity (0.4%) were found in subjects aged 50–74 years. 59.8% of the anti-HCV positive individuals were aware of their serological status. When considering a treatment cost of €7000/patient, implementing screening programmes is cost-effective across all age cohorts, particularly in those aged 50–54.
