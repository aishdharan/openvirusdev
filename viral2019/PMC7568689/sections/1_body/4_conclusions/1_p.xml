<p id="Par51">This review provides evidence of changing epidemiology of HCV transmission with a higher prevalence in the older population. Therefore, given the high prevalence in these groups of patients, it is conceivable that anti-HCV screening, with subsequent detection of HCV RNA, could be offered to people born between 1946 and 1964 to greatly reduce HCV infection worldwide via antiviral treatment. Programmes to eliminate HCV should include improvement to access to health care services, increased screening and new projects to identify a submerged portion of patients with chronic HCV infection.</p>
