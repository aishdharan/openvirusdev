<p id="para0007">As noted above, PLHCV have a higher proportion of injecting drug use in Canada and PLHCV who inject drugs also have higher proportion of co-occurring mental illness, HIV co-infection, HBV co-infection and material and social deprivation (
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">McKee et al., 2018</xref>). It is hypothesized that as PLHCV have higher drug use and are more marginalized, DRDs will be higher among them. However, there is no data assessing if the rate of DRDs is higher among PLHCV compared to HCV-negative individuals. We use a population-based database of all individuals tested for HCV in BC to compare rates and trends over time in DRD and liver-related deaths (LRDs) and identify whether there are differences in DRDs among PLHCV and HCV-negative individuals. We also quantify the impact of fentanyl on DRDs in our study population over the last decade.
