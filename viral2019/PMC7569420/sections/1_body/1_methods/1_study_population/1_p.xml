<p id="para0008">The BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC-HTC) includes more than 1.7 million individuals tested for HCV or HIV at the BC Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory and all confirmed cases of HBV, HCV, HIV, and active TB reported by the public health system in BC from 1990 to 2015. Individuals in BC are generally tested due to HCV risk, investigation of liver disease, routine screening in pregnancy and if they are undergoing procedures such as renal dialysis, and those tested during the mid-1990s as part of blood system lookbacks (

These data were integrated with data on prescription drug dispensations, physician diagnostic and billing data, hospitalization records, emergency department visits, cancers, and deaths and are described in more detail in Supplemental Table S1. Additional information about the BC-HTC, including methodology, data linkages, and population characteristics by HCV status has been published previously (

All residents in BC are registered in the publicly funded insurance plan that acts as a single payer system and covers services provided by fee-for-service practitioners, allowing for comprehensive population-level monitoring. Eligible individuals for this study had at least one HCV test (i.e., anti-HCV or HCV RNA) performed or were a reported HCV case from April 1992 to December 2015. Characterization of DRD was restricted to 2010 onwards to highlight the surge of DRDs among people with HCV over the last decade.
