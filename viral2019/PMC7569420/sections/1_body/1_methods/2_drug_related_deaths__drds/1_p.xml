<p id="para0009">DRDs were identified using BC Vital Statistics Agency (BCVSA) death registry, which includes all deaths registered in the province of BC, underlying and/or contributing cause of death mortality data, and categorized using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes (Supplemental Table S2). Any deaths not deemed “natural” (a death primarily resulting from a disease or progressive fatigue of the bodily systems) are investigated by the BC Coroners Service (BCCS). The finalization of the medical certificates of death can take anywhere from several months to several years from date of death. BCVSA processes information received from the BCCS on the finalized Medical Certificate of Death and applies these ICD-10 codes using an internationally standardized coding software provided by Statistics Canada. A broad definition specifying both acute and chronic poisonings was adapted from consensus recommendations for national and state poisoning surveillance developed by the Safe States Alliance (
