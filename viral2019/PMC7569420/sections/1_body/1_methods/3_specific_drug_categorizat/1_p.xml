<p id="para0010">In addition, ICD-10 multiple-cause codes provide information on the types of drugs or drug classes involved in the death (“T-codes”); of these, heroin (T40.1); natural/semisynthetic opioids (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioids other than methadone (including fentanyl and fentanyl analogues) (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); other and unspecified narcotics (40.6); and psychostimulants with abuse potential (T43.6) were used. Deaths involving methadone (T40.3) and natural/semisynthetic opioids such as hydrocodone and oxycodone (T40.2) are grouped together as prescription opioid deaths (

In 2016, in response to the DRD public health emergency, supplementary codes to identify deaths where fentanyl (“Z7221”) or carfetanil (“Z7222”) were specifically implicated in finalized death investigations were added to the “lifestyle / environmental” field in BCVSA mortality data files; thus, we also included these codes in our categorization of “synthetic opioids other than methadone.”
