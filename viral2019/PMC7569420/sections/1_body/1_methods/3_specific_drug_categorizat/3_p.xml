<p id="para0012">Lastly, if an underlying cause of death code was recorded as ICD-10 R99 (other ill-defined and unspecified causes, usually assigned when cause of death is still under investigation), and manner of death was listed as “pending,” “accident,” or “undetermined,” we re-categorized the death as drug-related if the death met the following criteria: attributable to a person aged 20 to 64 years who also injects drugs (defined as any drug-related diagnoses, use of injection drugs, record of opioid agonist therapy dispensation or injection related infection using physician diagnostic and billing data, hospitalizations, prescription data, vital statistics and emergency room data), based on validation studies in the US and in the BC-HTC (

 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">Janjua et al., 2018</xref>) to mitigate the impact of missing data on the analysis. As the majority of R99 codes are resolved within a few years as the BCCS completes investigations of sudden deaths prior to death categorization, we excluded deaths occurring after December 31
 <sup>st</sup>, 2018 to reduce the impact of open investigations and the need to impute missing data by re-categorizing deaths. While we were able include many DRDs with R99 codes in the analysis through application of our algorithm described above, it was not possible to assign T-codes to these deaths as these codes are only assigned in concluded investigations (

 <sup>st</sup>, 2017.
