<p id="para0014">We compared PLHCV and HCV-negative individuals who died of DRDs, estimated annual age and sex-adjusted drug-related mortality rates per 100,000 person-years (PY) for these groups and examined trends over time by sex. Rates are age and sex-standardized to the 1991 Canadian population. PY were calculated from either first HCV negative or first HCV positive date, censored at death or HCV sero-conversion. Secondly, we compared demographic and risk factor characteristics of people who died of liver- vs. drug-related causes and estimated annual age and sex-adjusted liver- and drug-related mortality rates per 100,000 PY for these groups. Lastly, we described the contribution or “co-involvement” of specific drugs, including fentanyl and its analogues, implicated in DRDs overall and stratified by HCV status over time. For instance, for deaths involving heroin, we identify what proportion also included fentanyl involvement each year using the T-codes described above assigned through coroner's investigation of each drug-related death. As more than one drug can contribute to a DRD, categories representing specific drug involvement in a DRD are not mutually exclusive. For descriptive analyses comparing groups, we used Wilcoxon's rank sum test for continuous variables and the chi
 <sup>2</sup> test for categorical data. SAS version 9.4 was used for all analyses.
