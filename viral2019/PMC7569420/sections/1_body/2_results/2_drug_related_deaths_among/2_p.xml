<p id="para0018">Annual drug-related standardized mortality rates among PLHCV and HCV-negative individuals by sex are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref> . Drug-related mortality was 1.3 (95% CI: 1.2-1.3) to 1.5 (95% CI: 1.5-1.6) times higher in men compared to women living with HCV and from 1.8 (95% CI: 1.5-2.3) to 3.3 (95% CI: 3.2-3.5) times higher among HCV negative men compared to women. Increases over time were observed for all groups, with rates among men without HCV increasing the most dramatically, from 27.1 per 100,000 PY in 2010 to 96.0 per 100,000 PY in 2018; a 3.5-fold increase (95% CI: 3.1-4.1). Increases over the same time period were also observed for men living with HCV (283.4 to 490.0 per 100,000 PY; 1.7 fold increase [95% CI: 1.7-1.8]) and women without HCV (14.8 to 29.0 per 100,000 PY; 2.0-fold increase [95% CI: 1.6-2.4]) and women living with HCV (184.4 to 372.2 per 100,000 PY; 2.0-fold increase [95% CI: 1.9-2.1]).
