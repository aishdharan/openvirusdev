 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> describes characteristics of PLHCV and HCV-negative individuals who died of drug-related (5,616) vs. liver-related (6,884) causes during the study period. Notably, the median age at death was 45 (interquartile range [IQR]: 35, 54) vs. 64 (IQR: 57, 72) years for DRDs and LRDs, respectively; a difference of 19 years. Individuals whose deaths were drug-related were more likely to be male (70.2% vs. 65.8%), younger (born after 1964: 63.4% vs. 9.1%), living with HIV (5.9% vs. 2.2%), have a history of injecting drug use (89.1% vs. 60.4%), a record of OAT (36.4% vs. 6.7%), major mental illness (55.8% vs. 25.3%) and diagnosis of psychosis (21.8% vs. 7.4%) compared to those who died of LRD. They were also more likely to rank in the most materially (31.1% vs. 25.7%) and socially (45.2% vs. 35.0%) deprived quintiles of the Québec Index of Material and Social Deprivation and less likely to have ever accessed HCV treatment (15.7% vs. 30.6%) or have HBV infection (4.5% vs. 9.0%).
