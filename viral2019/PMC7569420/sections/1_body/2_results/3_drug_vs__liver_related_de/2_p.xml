<p id="para0021">Annual liver- and drug-related standardized mortality rates among PLHCV and HCV-negative individuals and overall deaths are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref> . Drug-related mortality rate rose from 241.7 per 100,000 PY in 2010 to 436.5 per 100,000 PY (IRR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.7-1.9) in 2018 for PLHCV and from 20.0 to 57.1 per 100,000 PY (IRR: 2.9; 95% CI: 2.4-3.4) for HCV-negative individuals with the majority of the increase after 2014. From 2010 to 2018, liver-related mortality rates among PLHCV almost halved from 313.7 to 183.2 per 100,000 PY (IRR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.6-1.8); similarly, liver-related mortality rates among HCV-negative individuals decreased from 42.7 to 22.6 per 100,000 PY (IRR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.6-2.2) over the same period. Drug-related mortality overtook liver-related mortality for PLHCV in 2015 and HCV-negative individuals in 2016.
