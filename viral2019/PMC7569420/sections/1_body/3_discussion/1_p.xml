<p id="para0023">We examined DRDs in a population-based cohort of HCV testers in BC. We found that DRDs were higher among PLHCV compared to HCV-negative individuals. Drug-related causes have overtaken liver-related causes of death among PLHCV, accounting for more than a quarter of deaths in this population in 2018, with similar trends observed among HCV-negative individuals. Drug-related mortality has increased among men and women living with and without HCV since 2014; the steepness of the curves for each group has increased every year, indicating a worsening problem, with absolute rates several fold higher for PLHCV compared to HCV-negative individuals. Our data suggest that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are ubiquitous in the drug supply, contributing to more than three quarters of deaths involving opioids in 2017.</p>
