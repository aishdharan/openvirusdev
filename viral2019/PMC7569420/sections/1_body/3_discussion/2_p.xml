<p id="para0024">While injecting drug use was pervasive among both PLHCV and HCV-negative individuals dying of drug-related causes in BC, we found differences in group characteristics. PLHCV were older, had a higher proportion of co-occurring HIV, HBV infections and social and material deprivation and may therefore represent PWID with a longer duration of drug use. The median age of DRD in our study among HCV-negative individuals was 37 years (vs. 49 years among PLHCV); similarly, provincial data on overdose deaths illustrates that people between the ages of 30 and 39 years had the highest rate of illicit drug overdose deaths (57.4 per 100,000 person years) in 2018 (

These younger HCV-negative individuals could represent PWID with shorter duration of drug use who are dying before they have a chance to access drug-related treatment services or to acquire a blood-borne pathogen. Another explanation is that practices protecting people from acquiring blood-borne pathogens such as using drugs through non-injecting pathways do not protect against fentanyl exposure. More than half of overdose deaths in BC were not injecting-related in 2018 (
