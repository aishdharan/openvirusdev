<p id="para0025">Indeed, increasing rates of injecting drug use, acute HCV infection, and overdose deaths signal a crisis for public health in North America and elsewhere. Recent outbreaks of HIV following changing drug use practices and trends have been observed among PWID in both rural and urban settings. A rapid increase in new cases of HIV infection among PWID in Indiana (

 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2019</xref>). Overdose deaths and sequalae from drug use such as infectious disease acquisition are preventable; developing a comprehensive suite of services, such as integrating HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis services for PWID at risk of acquiring HIV as well as infectious disease treatment (antiretroviral treatment for HIV and DAA therapy for HCV) and medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (Singer, 2020) should be explored in these contexts.
