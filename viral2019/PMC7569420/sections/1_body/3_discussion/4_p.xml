<p id="para0026">Our results indicate that potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have increasingly contaminated the illicit drug supply in BC, with the proportion of deaths with co-involvement of synthetic opioids increasing sharply across all drug categories including cocaine and stimulant-related deaths since 2015. Substantiating these findings are drug testing results in BC, which found that 80% of drugs tested positive for fentanyl, including 84% of heroin samples, and 65% of non-opiate drugs such as crystal meth, ecstasy/MDMA, and cocaine (

While there was a decrease in overdose deaths in BC in 2019, the number of deaths and non-fatal overdoses remain at epidemic levels. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic era appears to have precipitated a striking spike in deaths, with June 2020 recording the highest number of illicit drug toxicity deaths observed in BC to date (
