<p id="para0027">Novel proximal level interventions such as take-home drug checking test strips may be explored to reduce the impact of the toxic drug supply on PWID. Existing harm reduction interventions such as supervised consumption sites and take-home naloxone kits are operational in BC and have averted an estimated 3000 deaths over a 20-month period during which 2,177 deaths were observed (
