<p id="para0029">There are several limitations to consider in our study. Recent deaths of undetermined intent (ICD-10 code R99) pending a coroner's investigation, with manner of death reported “pending,” “accident,” or “undetermined,” and classified as DRDs in our study based on age and PWID criteria may be misclassified, possibly leading to an over-estimation of DRD, though age restriction and history of IDU decreases likelihood of misclassification. An estimated 1.2% (1004/85,899) of all deaths in 2018 were assigned an ICD-10 R99 code. However, not including any of these deaths as drug-related would certainly under-estimate DRDs; we chose to be inclusive. Similarly, using administrative data to identify PWID, while a useful strategy for large population-level datasets, may also lead to misclassification. Another important consideration is that there may be temporal trends in the classification of deaths whereby investigation practices and therefore classification of deaths differed; for instance, as the overdose epidemic grew, it is possible that more deaths were investigated as drug-related. Next, although our inclusion criteria specify that everyone is tested for HCV on entry, DRDs among undiagnosed HCV seroconverters who do not have a positive test will be misclassified. Lastly, we see a decline in drug related mortality among men living with HCV in 2018 which preceded a decline in overall DRDs in BC surveillance data (
