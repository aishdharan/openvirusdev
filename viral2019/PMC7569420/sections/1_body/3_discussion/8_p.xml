<p id="para0030">In summary, fentanyl has significantly impacted mortality rates among PWID with and without HCV; widespread interventions to reduce harms and address the toxic drug supply are urgently needed. For PLHCV, DRDs represent a failure of engagement in care and a missed opportunity to deliver highly effective DAA treatment and resulting quality of life improvements. Thus, integration of overdose prevention and HCV services is necessary to improve survivability as well as quality of life of these populations and to realize the benefit of curative HCV therapy.</p>
