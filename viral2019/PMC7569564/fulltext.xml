Hainan Province, China reported 168 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including 112 imported cases on February 19, 2020, but successfully contained the epidemic within 1 month. We described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Hainan and compared these features between imported and local cases to provide information for other international epidemic areas.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We included 91 patients (56 imported and 35 local cases) from two designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Haikou, China, from January 20 to February 19, 2020. Data on the demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics were extracted from medical records. Patients were followed until April 21, 2020, and the levels of antibodies at the follow-ups were also analysed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Of the 91 patients, 78 (85.7%) patients were diagnosed within the first three weeks after the first case was identified (Day 1: Jan 22, 2020), while the number of local cases started to increase during the third week. No new cases occurred after Day 29. Fever and cough were two main clinical manifestations. In total, 15 (16.5%) patients were severe, 14 (15.4%) had complicated infections, nine (9.9%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and three died. The median duration of viral shedding in feces was longer than that in nasopharyngeal swabs (19&#x02009;days vs 16&#x02009;days, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007). Compared with local cases, imported cases were older and had a higher incidence of fever and concurrent infections. There was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. IgG was positive in 92.8% patients (77/83) in the follow-up at week 2 after discharge, while 88.4% patients (38/43) had a reduction in IgG levels in the follow-up at week 4 after discharge, and the median level was lower than that in the follow-up at week 2 (10.95&#x02009;S/Cut Off (S/CO) vs 15.02&#x02009;S/CO, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x000a0;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Imported cases were more severe than local cases but had similar prognoses. The level of IgG antibodies declined from week 6 to week 8 after onset. The short epidemic period in Hainan suggests that the epidemic could be quickly brought under control if proper timely measures were taken.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronavirus disease 2019</kwd><kwd>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Clinical features</kwd><kwd>Prevention and control</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013076</institution-id><institution>National Major Science and Technology Projects of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018ZX10302204</award-id><award-id>2017ZX10203201003</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is characterized by lung damage, was first reported in December 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. By September 7, 2020, there has been reported 27&#x02009;032&#x02009;617 cases and 881&#x02009;464 deaths in 213 countries and territories worldwide and, with a crude mortality of 3.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although COVID-19 is likely a zoonotic disease, it can be transmitted from person to person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with a reproductive number of 1.5&#x02013;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted by contact and droplets but can also be transmitted through the digestive tract and conjunctiva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. At present, the numbers of COVID-19 cases in USA, India, Brazil and other countries are increasing rapidly, and many are locally incident cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As is known, the containment of epidemics at the early stage is the most critical, effective and efficient before the outbreak goes out of control. Although many countries once contained the spread of the epidemic, new imported cases are now emerging again. The prevention and control of the epidemic still faces great challenges.</p><p id="Par19">Hainan Province is a popular domestic and international tourist destination with 9.34 million permanent residents. During the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, many people spent their vacations on Hainan Island. According to the statistics, from December 30, 2019, to January 22, 2020, which was the day before Wuhan closed its outbound channel, approximately 74&#x02009;600 tourists had travelled from Wuhan to Hainan by plane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the first case of COVID-19 in Hainan was reported on January 22, 2020 (Day 1). Compared with other regions except Wuhan, Hainan Province was under greater pressure to prevent and control the epidemic. However, the last confirmed patient in Hainan was reported on February 19, 2020 (Day 29) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The relatively short epidemics period is largely attributable to the strict isolation and prevention measures implemented from top to bottom throughout the country, and it also implies that the measures that Hainan adopted to contain the epidemic were timely and successful. Thus, Hainan&#x02019;s experience may have important implications for other international epidemic areas.

No new local cases occurred after February 19, 2020. The 91 cases in this study accounted for 54.2% of all the confirmed cases in Hainan, and a similar trend was found in the epidemic course (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of the 91 patients, three patients died. The mortality rate was similar to that of the whole Hainan Province.</p><p id="Par35">Our study shows that during the 29-day epidemic period, most of the patients were diagnosed within the first three weeks after the first identified imported case. In the early period, imported cases were predominant in the epidemic. In the later period, local cases were more common, and 77.1% of the patients showed clustering, mainly in families. Cluster outbreaks were also found in Guangzhou patients in Lin&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These findings suggest increasing transmissibility of the virus during the spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and, hence, a great challenge in overall prevention and control. However, the local cases did not lead to continuous community transmission, as reflected by the short epidemic period (29&#x02009;days). This may be attributed to the strict isolation and prevention measures implemented throughout the country and the effective implementation of prevention and control policies by Hainan (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The measures included establishing fever clinics for screening suspicious patients, designating hospitals to focus on treating patients with COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and raising the level of emergency response to COVID-19 prevention and control to the first level promptly at day 4. At the same time, other measures also worked well in blocking the routes of transmission and reducing the chance of infection. Examples include encouraging the public to wear face masks, wash hands more frequently, and stay at home unless necessary and activating joint prevention and control mechanisms and cross-sector control for traffic control at the community level. Moreover, delaying the resumption of work and school and implementing work-from-home policies for employees and online teaching for students were adopted to reduce the probability of clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The reported estimated incubation time of SARS-CoV-2 was based on limited data. Zhong reported that the median incubation period was four&#x02009;days in 291 cases in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Xu et al. found that there is no observable difference between the incubation time for SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), with a mean of 4.9&#x02009;days for SARS-CoV-2, 4.7&#x02009;days for SARS, and 5.8&#x02009;days for MERS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To avoid the risk of virus spreading, all potentially exposed subjects were required to be isolated for 14&#x02009;days, which is the longest predicted incubation time. Our epidemiological investigation of 53 patients from Wuhan found that the median time of symptom onset was five&#x02009;days, with a range of one&#x02009;day to 34&#x02009;days. The patient with the longest incubation period, who was a male in their 70s, flew from Wuhan to Hainan on January 2, 2020 and had no contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. He occasionally went to the farmers&#x02019; market near his residence to buy vegetables, but there were no confirmed COVID-19 patients associated with the market. He developed symptoms on February 5 and was diagnosed on February 7, 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This particular case indicates that the longest incubation time may be more than 34&#x02009;days.</p><p id="Par36">This study showed that the main symptoms of patients in Hainan Province were fever and cough, and 30% of patients had shortness of breath. Compared with early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, diarrhea (14.3%) was relatively more common in Hainan patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The main complications included infections and ARDS. Six severe cases developed to MODS. In general, the proportions of severe patients and mortalities were lower than those of Wuhan and similar to the national data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In the imported cases, the proportion of patients with fever, the peak temperature, the level of blood CRP, the proportion of severe cases, and the incidence of complications, especially infections, were higher than those in the local cases. Meanwhile, the lymphocyte and platelets counts were significantly lower in imported cases than in local cases. Data showed that the imported cases were older, and coexisting illness was more common than in local cases, which might demonstrate why the imported cases were more severe. Another possible explanation is that the time of infection SARA-CoV-2 in imported cases was earlier, with a more virulent virus subtype. However, this requires further study of the genomics and pathogenicity of SARA-CoV-2 at different stages of transmission. Tang&#x02019;s research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 had formed two subtypes, S and L, during the transmission process, and changes in viral genes will cause changes in pathogenicity and transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A similar study had been conducted for the MERS virus, which had shown that the virus becomes weaker during transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It remains to be further studied whether there was virus mutation in the process of virus transmission from imported cases to local cases, which may have led to the weakening of its pathogenicity. Furthermore, given the experience in Wuhan, the Hainan government was well-prepared for the epidemic, and comprehensive screening allowed early case identification and prompt treatment.</p><p id="Par38">All 91 patients, including four asymptomatic patients, had CT changes in the lungs, which mainly manifested as ground-glass opacity in the lung periphery in the early stage. However, as the disease progressed, some patients had pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusion. Therefore, pulmonary CT examination is a sensitive indicator for the screening of COVID-19 and is recommended for all suspected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Even so, SARS-CoV-2 RNA provides direct evidence for confirming COVID-19. Among all our patients, SARS-COV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, but RNA was not detected in 12 patients&#x02019; feces. Due to the positive detecting of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces, the problem of gastrointestinal transmission and even aerosol transmission has attracted broad attention. Since then, multiple research teams have isolated viruses in the feces, further illustrating the risk of gastrointestinal transmission.</p><p id="Par40">However, for a new viral infectious disease, there is no exact data on how long virus will be shed through the respiratory and digestive tracts. Our study found that the median duration of fecal SARS-CoV-2 shedding was longer than that in nasopharyngeal swabs, with durations of 19 and 16&#x02009;days, respectively. And the longest times of SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistent positive testing and viral shedding were 40&#x02009;days and 43&#x02009;days, respectively. The relatively long virus shedding duration could pose a great challenge for health systems as the patient pool flows slowly and takes up substantial health facility resources. While it is impossible to host all positive cases in hospitals throughout the virus shedding period, it is possible to shift less-acute cases to other temporary facilities as done in Wuhan. It is worth noting that the nasopharyngeal swabs and feces collected on the day of death of the three critically ill patients were still positive. This suggests that the persistence of the virus may have an impact on the disease prognosis, and it is urgent to screen and develop effective antiviral drugs.</p><p id="Par41">Unfortunately, currently, there are no effective antiviral drugs.

However, without a controlled study, it is difficult to determine whether it is the natural fluctuation of the virus replication or the effect of the drug.</p><p id="Par42">Since there were no available testing kits in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, data on antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were only collected in the follow-up after discharge. We observed a high positive rate of IgG and a reduction in the IgG level at a median of 48&#x02009;days (IQR: 44&#x02013;53) from symptom onset, which was within six to eight weeks from onset. As reported by Long, IgG levels start to decrease within 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;months after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These findings may challenge attempts to control COVID-19 through universal immunization, as patients with reduced antibody levels may be re-infected. Of course, the subsequent changes in antibody levels require further observation.</p><p id="Par43">There are some limitations in this study. Due to the barriers to data collection, the clinical data of all 168 patients in the entire Hainan Province have not been collected. In addition, some patients could not be followed up for a long time because they left Hainan after recovery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">Our study revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcomes of imported and local cases outside Hubei Province, suggesting that imported cases were more severe than local cases, but the prognoses could be similarly good. The short epidemic period in Hainan suggests that the epidemic could be quickly brought under control if proper timely measures were taken. This study also suggests that the longest incubation period for COVID-19 may be over 34&#x02009;days and that the maximum duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding is at least 43&#x02009;days. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was high during convalescence; however, the level of IgG declined from week six to week eight after onset.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>COVID-19</term><def><p id="Par5">Coronavirus disease 2019</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARS-CoV-2</term><def><p id="Par6">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>S/CO</term><def><p id="Par7">S/Cut Off</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARDS</term><def><p id="Par8">Acute respiratory distress syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par9">Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par10">C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCT</term><def><p id="Par11">Procalcitonin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par12">Centre for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par13">Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par14">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par15">Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MODS</term><def><p id="Par16">Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECMO</term><def><p id="Par17">Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Biao Wu, Zi-Ying Lei, Kun-Liang Wu, Jian-Rong He, Hui-Juan Cao, Juan Fu and Bing-Liang Lin contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p>Jing He and Feng Lin contributed equally with the corresponding author, but not the first authors of this work.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>B Wu, ZY Lei, KL Wu, JR He, J Fu, F Chen, Y Chen, B Chen, XL Zhou, T Wu, YG D, SX Chen, FR Xiao, J He, F Lin and BL Lin collected the epidemiological and clinical data and processed the statistical data.
