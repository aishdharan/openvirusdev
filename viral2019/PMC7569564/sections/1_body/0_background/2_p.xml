<p id="Par19">Hainan Province is a popular domestic and international tourist destination with 9.34 million permanent residents. During the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, many people spent their vacations on Hainan Island. According to the statistics, from December 30, 2019, to January 22, 2020, which was the day before Wuhan closed its outbound channel, approximately 74 600 tourists had travelled from Wuhan to Hainan by plane [

Compared with other regions except Wuhan, Hainan Province was under greater pressure to prevent and control the epidemic. However, the last confirmed patient in Hainan was reported on February 19, 2020 (Day 29) (Fig.

The relatively short epidemics period is largely attributable to the strict isolation and prevention measures implemented from top to bottom throughout the country, and it also implies that the measures that Hainan adopted to contain the epidemic were timely and successful. Thus, Hainan’s experience may have important implications for other international epidemic areas.
