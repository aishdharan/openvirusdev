<p id="Par24">SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing was performed by the hospital’s laboratory and the key laboratory of Hainan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), China, by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) according to the diagnosis protocol for COVID-19 established by the WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The nasopharyngeal swab and feces were collected every 2–7 days during hospitalization and twice every seven days during follow-up for discharged cases. Then, the RNA samples from the nasal swab and feces specimens were extracted and subjected to real-time RT-PCR testing using SARS-CoV-2-specific primers and probes. Specifically, the primers for the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) were 5′-CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA-3′(Forward) and 5′-ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA-3′(Reverse), and the corresponding probe was 5′-CY3-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1–3′. Primers for the nucleocapsid protein (N) were 5′-GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3′ (Forward) and 5′-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG-3′ (Reverse), and the corresponding probe was 5′-FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3′. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding was defined as the time from symptom onset to the first negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test after the last SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive test during the follow-up.
