<p id="Par28">All 91 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hainan General Hospital (
 <italic>n</italic> = 69) and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical university (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22) were enrolled. Of the 91 patients, 56 were imported and 35 were local patients. The mean age was 50 years, and 57.1% were male. This outbreak lasted one month from the first patient admittance on January 20, 2020, to the last patient on February 19, 2020 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of these patients, 78 were admitted within the first 3 weeks after the first case was identified, 88.6% (31/35) of local patients were admitted by day 14, and these statistics were similar to the overall patient statistics in Hainan Province. Of all 168 patients, 142 new cases were confirmed before day 21, and 52 local patients were diagnosed after day 14 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Among 56 imported patients in two hospitals, 53 (94.6%) came from Wuhan City and its surrounding area. The median interval period between leaving Wuhan to symptom onset in 53 patients was 5 days (IQR: 2–12, range 1–34). Overall, 42 (46.2%) patients had a history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients, with a median interval before onset of 8 days (IQR: 4–13, range: 1–22). Compared to imported patients, the local patients were significantly younger (mean age, 46 years vs 52 years; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), more likely to occur in cluster outbreaks (77.1% vs 46.4%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004), and had close contact with COVID-19 patients (68.6% vs 32.1%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) (Table
