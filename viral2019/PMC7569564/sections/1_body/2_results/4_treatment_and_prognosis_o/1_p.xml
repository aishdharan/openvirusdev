<p id="Par32">The median time that patients stayed in the hospital was 14 days (IQR: 11–18). All the patients took Chinese traditional medicinal treatment, and 89 (97.8%) patients were treated with antiviral therapy, including lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra), arbidol and atomized inhalation of interferon α. In total, 22 patients were treated with immunoglobulin, and 20 were treated with thymosin α-1. Overall, 13 patients received short-term corticosteroids treatment, with 40–80 mg/d methylprednisolone for 3–5 days. Only one patient needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) but died. By March 24, 2020, 88 of 91 patients had been discharged, and three patients had died. There was no significant difference in the treatment, length of hospitalization or clinical outcome between the imported and local patients (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). All the patients had been followed for more than 14 days after discharge, and no nucleic acid detection test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was returned as positive. IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in plasma samples were tested in 83 patients in the follow-up at week 2 after discharge. IgM was positive in 33 patients (39.8%), and IgG was positive in 77 patients (92.8%). As some of the patients had left Hainan, only 43 patients had a second detection of antibodies in the follow-up at week 4 after discharge (median, 48 days from onset; IQR: 44–53 days). Among these patients, 88.4% (38/43) had a reduction in IgG levels. The IgG levels (median S/CO, 10.95; IQR: 3.74–20.95) at week 4 after discharge were significantly lower than the levels (median S/CO, 15.02; IQR: 4.24–36.23) at week 2 (
