<p id="Par33">We tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs and feces of all the patients at an interval of 2 to 7 days dynamically. All 91 patients had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, and 79 had detectable levels in feces. SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs and feces at medians of 11 days (IQR: 6–16, range: 1–39) and 13 days (IQR: 10–19, range: 1–40), respectively. The viral shedding durations in these two types of samples were 16 days (IQR: 13–23, range: 6–43 days) and 19 days (IQR: 14–26, range: 6–43) from onset, respectively. The durations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing being positive and viral shedding in feces were longer than that of nasopharyngeal swabs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007, respectively). In samples (including nasopharyngeal swabs and feces) from three dead patients, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained positive on the day of death (37 days, 20 days and 17 days from symptom onset, respectively). There was no significant difference in the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity or the duration of viral shedding in nasopharyngeal swabs and feces between the imported and local patients (Table
