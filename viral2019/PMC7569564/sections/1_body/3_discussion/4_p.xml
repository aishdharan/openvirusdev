<p id="Par37">In the imported cases, the proportion of patients with fever, the peak temperature, the level of blood CRP, the proportion of severe cases, and the incidence of complications, especially infections, were higher than those in the local cases. Meanwhile, the lymphocyte and platelets counts were significantly lower in imported cases than in local cases. Data showed that the imported cases were older, and coexisting illness was more common than in local cases, which might demonstrate why the imported cases were more severe. Another possible explanation is that the time of infection SARA-CoV-2 in imported cases was earlier, with a more virulent virus subtype. However, this requires further study of the genomics and pathogenicity of SARA-CoV-2 at different stages of transmission. Tangâ€™s research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 had formed two subtypes, S and L, during the transmission process, and changes in viral genes will cause changes in pathogenicity and transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It remains to be further studied whether there was virus mutation in the process of virus transmission from imported cases to local cases, which may have led to the weakening of its pathogenicity. Furthermore, given the experience in Wuhan, the Hainan government was well-prepared for the epidemic, and comprehensive screening allowed early case identification and prompt treatment.
