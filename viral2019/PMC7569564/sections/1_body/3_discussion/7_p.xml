<p id="Par40">However, for a new viral infectious disease, there is no exact data on how long virus will be shed through the respiratory and digestive tracts. Our study found that the median duration of fecal SARS-CoV-2 shedding was longer than that in nasopharyngeal swabs, with durations of 19 and 16 days, respectively. And the longest times of SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistent positive testing and viral shedding were 40 days and 43 days, respectively. The relatively long virus shedding duration could pose a great challenge for health systems as the patient pool flows slowly and takes up substantial health facility resources. While it is impossible to host all positive cases in hospitals throughout the virus shedding period, it is possible to shift less-acute cases to other temporary facilities as done in Wuhan. It is worth noting that the nasopharyngeal swabs and feces collected on the day of death of the three critically ill patients were still positive. This suggests that the persistence of the virus may have an impact on the disease prognosis, and it is urgent to screen and develop effective antiviral drugs.</p>
