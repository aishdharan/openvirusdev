<p id="Par42">Since there were no available testing kits in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, data on antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were only collected in the follow-up after discharge. We observed a high positive rate of IgG and a reduction in the IgG level at a median of 48 days (IQR: 44–53) from symptom onset, which was within six to eight weeks from onset. As reported by Long, IgG levels start to decrease within 2–3 months after infection [
