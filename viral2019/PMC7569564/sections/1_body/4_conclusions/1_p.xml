<p id="Par44">Our study revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcomes of imported and local cases outside Hubei Province, suggesting that imported cases were more severe than local cases, but the prognoses could be similarly good. The short epidemic period in Hainan suggests that the epidemic could be quickly brought under control if proper timely measures were taken. This study also suggests that the longest incubation period for COVID-19 may be over 34 days and that the maximum duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding is at least 43 days. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was high during convalescence; however, the level of IgG declined from week six to week eight after onset.</p>
