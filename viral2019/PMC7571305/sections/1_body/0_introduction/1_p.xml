<p id="Par2">Hantaviruses are negative-sense, single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the family 
 <italic>Hantaviridae</italic>. Since the first hantavirus was isolated in 1978, many countries and regions have reported a series of hantavirus infections continuously (Lee 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1978</xref>). Hantaviruses cause two clinical syndromes in humans; designated hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HFRS mostly occur in Eurasian countries, caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava virus (DOBV) (Avsic-Zupanc 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>). The clinical features of HFRS are severe systemic manifestations, including fever, hemorrhage and acute renal failure. HPS is mainly a group of syndromes with respiratory system involvement, caused by Sin Nombre virus (SNV), Andes virus, and other viruses. The leading cause of death in HPS is acute progressive non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and respiratory failure (Peters
