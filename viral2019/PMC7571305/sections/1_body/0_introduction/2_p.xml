<p id="Par3">Hantaviruses are zoonotic viruses that can be carried by small rodents. Approximately 20,000 cases of hantavirus-related diseases occur worldwide each year (Jiang

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>). Furthermore, there is a clear indication that the incidence rate increases every year (Jiang

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>; Watson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2014</xref>). The mortality rates reported are 12% for HFRS and 60% for HPS (Zhang

 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). Pregnant women are afflicted by inhalation of host secretions and excretions carrying the virus, or by exposure to rodent carriers (Pedrosa and Cardoso 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2011</xref>). However, the cases of women infected with hantavirus during pregnancy are rarely reported even in areas where hantaviruses are concentrated, which poses certain difficulties for subsequent research and clinical management. Here, in order to contribute to the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction, we reviewed past cases of hantavirus infections in pregnant women.
