<p id="Par4">As reported in the existing literature, pregnant women with hantavirus infection mainly live in areas where hantaviruses are prevalent. Almost every pregnant woman infected with hantaviruses during pregnancy has a clear history of exposure to the epidemic area (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, the epidemiological distribution primarily relies on the rodent host distribution, and it is influenced by factors such as the climate, environment, and food availability, which can make up a unique rodent host-hantavirus system. The rodent hosts of principal disease-causing hantaviruses are
