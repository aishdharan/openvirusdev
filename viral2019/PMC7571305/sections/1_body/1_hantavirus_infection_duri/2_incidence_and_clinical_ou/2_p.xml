<p id="Par6">Hantavirus infection with different species during pregnancy also has different results for pregnant women. As observed from our statistical review, the mortality rate of pregnant women infected with HTNV/SEOV was 10.5% (27/256) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and that of those infected with SNV was 25.0% (2/8) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). From the data we collected, the mortality rate of pregnant women infected with HTNV was not significantly different from that of the general population, while that of those infected with SNV was lower than that of the general population (Zhang

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). We speculate that the sample size may primarily limit this. Moreover, after being infected by a hantavirus, the residual sequelae, which mainly consist of menstrual disorders, amenorrhea, no milk secretion after delivery, sexual dysfunction, hair loss, autonomic dysfunction and chronic renal insufficiency, were only seen with HTNV/SEOV infections (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Furthermore, no deaths have been reported in pregnant women infected with PUUV or DOBV (Hofmann

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>; Partanen 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1993</xref>). However, PUUV and DOBV cannot be ruled out due to the limited number of cases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
