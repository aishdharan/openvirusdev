<p id="Par7">The clinical outcome for fetuses is also significantly different. Since the death of the mother causes the death of the fetus in most cases, this review will only discuss the cases where the mother survived the hantavirus infection. According to the available data, fetal deaths were only reported in HTNV/SEOV and SNV infections (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The mortality rate of fetuses delivered by pregnant women with HTNV/SEOV infections was 31.8% (71/223) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and that of those delivered by pregnant women with SNV was 33.3% (2/6) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Also, several sequelae, including congenital heart disease, necrotizing enteritis, restricted growth and development, as well as hydrocephalus, troubled these babies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The incidence rate of sequelae in the babies, whose mothers had been infected with HTNV/SEOV and SNV was 3.6% (8/223) and 16.7% (1/6), respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
