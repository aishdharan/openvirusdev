 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1990</xref>) presented a case, where a 29 year-old woman at 17 weeks gestation had suffered from acute abdominal pain with high fever and myalgia. As a result, she had been diagnosed with PUUV infection. After treatment, the woman had recovered within 4 weeks and delivered a healthy boy naturally. Besides, the postoperative serological testing showed no evidence of placental transmission. However, few cases of fetal death caused by PUUV infection were also reported (Partanen

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>) conducted an immunological and molecular analysis of hantaviruses in the cord blood of four pregnant women, who had been infected with PUUV or DOBV. The results also showed no evidence of virus transmission through the placenta. Howard

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>) reviewed five cases of HPS during pregnancy, and as expected, there was no evidence of vertical transmission, though SNV infections mostly had severe consequences, even death, in pregnant women and fetuses.
