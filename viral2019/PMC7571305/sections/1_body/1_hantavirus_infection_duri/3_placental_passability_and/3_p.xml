 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1978</xref>) studied a pregnant woman, who had had a miscarriage due to hypotension after SEOV infection. After the autopsy of the fetus, researchers found bleeding throughout the body, including lungs, kidneys, and adrenal glands. This is in line with the symptoms of SEOV infection, but unfortunately, they did not perform further serological testing of the fetus (Kim

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1994</xref>), isolated hantaviruses from fetal brain tissues of an aborted fetus. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that hantaviruses could pass not only the placental barrier but also the blood–brain barrier. However, it is a pity that the study failed to identify the species. Instead, it was based on the epidemiological analysis of the target area, which indicated that the virus was most likely SEOV. Most of the abortion and stillbirth cases in patients with HFRS occur when they have a fever, so further research is needed to clarify the specific mechanism (Chen
