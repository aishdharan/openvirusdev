<p id="Par12">The incidence of hantavirus infection in pregnant women varies in different gestational periods. By reviewing the literature, we conducted a statistical analysis of the gestational age of women with a hantavirus infection during pregnancy. Among the reported cases of hantavirus-infected pregnant women, the incidence rate in the first trimester (&lt; 13 weeks) was 7.7% (4/52) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), whereas that in the second trimester (≥ 13 weeks, &lt; 28 weeks) and the third trimester (≥ 28 weeks) was 92.3% (48/52) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Coincidentally, this phenomenon was also found in other placenta-transmissible viruses. Zhao (

Moreover, having researched Epstein-Barr virus infection in pregnant women at different stages of pregnancy, Ming (
