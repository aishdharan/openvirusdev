<p id="Par16">Currently, there is no safe and effective treatment for pregnant women with hemorrhagic fever. Recently, new treatments have been developed, and satisfying medical results have been achieved. For example, pregnant women with a hantavirus infection during pregnancy can benefit from symptomatic treatment and supportive care, mainly including diuresis, hemodialysis, oxygen therapy, shock therapy, liver protection therapy and liquid therapy. However, increased cardiac load during pregnancy and pulmonary capillary damage caused by the hantavirus infection are more likely to cause ARDS and heart failure. Hence, it is essential to control the infusion rate during oliguria (Chen

Last but not the least, glucocorticoids have strong anti-inflammatory effects and are widely used in patients with stubborn and unresolved renal failure. However, the question that needs to be studied further is whether glucocorticoids can improve the health of the patients (Kruger
