<p id="Par18">Although there are not many cases of hantavirus infection reported in pregnant women, even in the endemic areas, clinicians are expected to thoroughly consider severe consequences when they receive patients with similar symptoms. Specific immune status of pregnant women might increase their susceptibility to hantavirus infection. Pregnant women have unique immunology and physiology, and their immune system can develop a particular immunosuppressive state by suppressing cellular immunity to tolerate fetal antigens of paternal origin (Beigi

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>). However, maintenance of this specific immune state during pregnancy has not been thoroughly explored. Gaunt and Ramin (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>) believe that this immunosuppressive state might be closely related to factors such as the absence of MHC-I antigens, the presence of unique HLA surface molecules, and nonspecific reduction of systemic immunoreactivity. Moreover, the blocking antibody, expressions of complement regulatory proteins, and reduced immunoreactivity might contribute to the formation of this unique immune state. These changes are likely to influence a systemic immune response to infections and lead to increased susceptibility to hantavirus infection.
