<p id="Par19">After being infected with hantavirus, pregnant women and their fetuses seem to have worse clinical symptoms and outcomes (Sha

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2000</xref>; Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2003</xref>) Nevertheless, currently, no theory can entirely explain the mechanism behind this phenomenon. In similar research of other viruses, this phenomenon is attributed to the unique immunological and physiological characteristics of pregnant women (Beigi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>; Beigh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>). However, patients’ immune response to a hantavirus infection, such as cytokine storms, is likely to harm the body (Schönrich 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2008</xref>). Pregnant women are in a specific state of immunosuppression, and their immune damage is much smaller than that of other people, which is inconsistent with the findings of this literature review. Therefore, it can be speculated that the cause for this difference might come from two aspects. Primarily, pregnancy increases the organ burden of patients with a hantavirus infection, worsens the health, and increases the risk of death (Guimarães 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>). Additionally, the flow dynamics of patients might change during pregnancy. Consequently, the synthesis of clotting factors increases, and the placenta synthesizes a large number of thrombogenic substances (Avsic-Zupanc 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
