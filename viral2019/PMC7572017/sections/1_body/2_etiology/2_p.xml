<p>Coronaviruses refer to single positive-stranded RNA viruses that roundly or ovally shaped (usually polymorphous) with envelope, which is characterized by the corolla shaped periphery protrusion on the viral envelope and is frequently associated with acute respiratory infections in humans that belong to a more sophisticated class of pathogens.

 </sup> namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that initiate severe respiratory disease in humans, have spread worldwide and attracted much international attention. The Gao's Group disclosed that SARS-COV-2, different from genetic characteristics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, is a novel coronavirus.

 </sup> The physicochemical characteristics of SARS-COV-2 have not yet been clarified, and it is generally accepted that SARS-COV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat and can be effectively killed by lipid solvents such as diethyl ether, while chlorhexidine is with poor effects.

 </sup> SARS-COV-2 is an RNA virus that may mutate during the occurrence and development of the disease, thereby making it more difficult for epidemic prevention and control.
