<p>SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus of β-coronavirus. The S protein on its capsule membrane is a crucial protein for invading target cells. It binds to the target cell receptor ACE2 through the S protein and then begins to replicate and drift in large numbers after entering the target cells. The human body can eliminate SARS-CoV-2 through the occurrence of an immune response. However, the affinity between S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and target cell ACE2 is 10 to 20 times stronger than that of SARS, which may be the main reason for its strong infectivity, infectivity, and pathogenicity.
