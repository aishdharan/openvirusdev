<p>CSS is an over-immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 in the body, resulting in an imbalance of cytokine levels, such as TNF-α, IL-1, IFN-γ, IFN-α, and IFN-β.

 </sup> Consequently, it is easy to make the immune system out of control and cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), ARDS, septic shock, multiple organ failure (MOF), and even death. de Wit et al

 </sup> reported that the characteristics of CCS caused by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, or MERS-CoV are different. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, TNF-α, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP10) cytokines were highly expressed, and the expression levels of TNF-α and G-CSF were firmly related to the degree of illness, which was different from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection. After MERS-CoV infection, lung inflammation was caused by high expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. After SARS-CoV infection, high expression of IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ other cytokines resulted in the extensive pulmonary inflammatory response.
