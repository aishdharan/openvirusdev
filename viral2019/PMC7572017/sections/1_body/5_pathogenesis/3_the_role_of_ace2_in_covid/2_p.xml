<p>SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor through S protein on the capsule, then enters the cell through endocytosis, and infecting the ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II alveolar cells in the lung. AP2 related protein kinase 1 (AAK1) is the main regulatory factor of endocytosis. The damage of AAK1 can prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering the cell and inhibit the replication of the virus. Therefore, AAK1 inhibitor agents may become a potential target drug for anti-COVID-19 therapy in the future. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) imbalances, and serum Ang II expression level increased. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy can significantly reduce the high levels of cytokines and lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 </sup> We believe that the regulation of ACEI levels or the treatment of COVID-19 with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may be future research hotspots.
