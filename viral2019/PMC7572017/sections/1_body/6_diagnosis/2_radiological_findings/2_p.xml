 </sup> In the early stage, due to pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, alveolar septal telangiectasia and congestion, CT mostly shows unilateral or scattered ground-glass opacity, which may be patchy and clumped, in which bronchial inflation sign is observed. After alveolar fluid exudation and interlobular septal interstitial edema, it may also disclose consolidation, nodular shadow, intralobular septal thickening, and interstitial changes and other forms. The lesions mostly involve the outer lung field and subpleural area (Fig.

 </sup> analyzed 14 cases in early-stage and found that there was a time difference in clinical symptoms and CT findings in some patients (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In some patients, the density of the lesion is pale, and the extent is small in the early stage, and chest radiography shows that it is easy to miss the diagnosis. Chest CT is recommended to replace chest radiography in those with conditions.
