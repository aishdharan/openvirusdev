<p>In the advanced stage, alveolar and interstitial edema are further aggravated due to the accumulation of a large amount of exudate in the alveolar space, and fibrinoid exudation causes alveolar fusion. CT findings develop from an early small shadow to a large consolidation of fusion, and a single lesion develops into multiple lesions (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), in which the pneumatic bronchus sign is seen.

 </sup> However, the lesions around the nodules may have “anti-fainting sign,” fine grid shadows (fine vascular network) can be seen in the lesions, some lesions have “anti-fainting sign,” the lesions are mostly located under the pleura of the middle and lower lobes of both lungs, and pleural effusion is rare.
