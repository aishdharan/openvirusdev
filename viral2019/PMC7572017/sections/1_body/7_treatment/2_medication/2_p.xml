<p>At present, there is no specific vaccine and antiviral drug, and research and development of a vaccine have its cycle and rule, which cannot be applied in clinical practice in the short term. Guidelines recommend that interferon-alpha, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, can be tried.

 </sup> Interferon-alpha enhances immunity, Lopinavir is a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, and Ritonavir can inhibit Lopinavir metabolism thereby increasing its plasma concentration, so Lopinavir is usually used in combination with Ritonavir. During SARS in 2003, Hong Kong scholars found that Lopinavir combined with Ritonavir reduced the risk of ARDS and death compared with ribavirin monotherapy alone.

 </sup> Early application of Lopinavir/Ritonavir against coronavirus can reduce patient mortality and glucocorticoid dosage, and late application has no significant effect. Therefore, early use of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in patients with confirmed COVID-19 may be beneficial in clinical practice, but its efficacy and safety are still controversial and need to be further evaluated.
