 <caption> The CT images of a 53-year-old man with new coronavirus pneumonia show the progression of the disease. A. Initial CT examination revealed a small flaky high-density shadow in the lower lobe of the right lung. B. CT examination 3 days later revealed irregular ground glass shadows. C–D. CT scan was re-examined 6 days later, showing multiple thin ground glass shadows, indicating a significant deterioration of the disease. E–F. CT examination 10 days later revealed multiple patchy ground glass shadows in both lungs, accompanied by consolidation and fiber cord shadows. G–I. CT examination 14 days later revealed the appearance of “white lung” with an air bronchogram. J–L. The condition improved after treatment. CT = computed tomography. </caption>
