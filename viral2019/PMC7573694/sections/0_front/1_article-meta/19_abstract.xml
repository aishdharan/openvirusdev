 <p>Short-term exposure to air pollutants, including PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
  <sub>10</sub>, NO
  <sub>2</sub>, may contribute to an increase in the counts of daily onset cases. Stringent prevention and control measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the virus spread by reducing air pollution, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.
