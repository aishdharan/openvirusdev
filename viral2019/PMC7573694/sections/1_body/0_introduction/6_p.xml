<p id="p0045">Although the spread of COVID-19 epidemic has significantly declined in some countries, e.g. China, the number of cases is still increasing rapidly from a global perspective. It is of great significance to clarify the possible influencing factors as air pollutants for COVID-19 epidemic. This study aims to describe the trend of air pollutants and incidence of COVID-19 during the epidemic and explores the association between air pollutants and daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 base on both onset and report dates. In order to assess the effects of air pollution on the transmission of COVID-19, time series data of main ambient air pollutants (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, CO, SO
 <sub>2</sub> and O
 <sub>3</sub>) and meteorological variables (temperature, dew point temperature and wind speed) over the study period (Dec. 1st, 2019 to Apr. 6th, 2020), together with daily COVID-19 confirmed cases have been examined through generalized additive models (GAMs). In addition, the study and further assesses the effects of various prevention and control measures on the variation trend of COVID-19 and the association with air pollution in totally 235 cities in China.
