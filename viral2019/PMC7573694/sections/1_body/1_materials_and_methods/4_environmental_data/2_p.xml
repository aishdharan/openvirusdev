<p id="p0060">The Daily ambient air pollution data for 367 Chinese major cities were collected at China’s National Environmental Monitoring Center from Dec. 1st, 2019 to Apr. 6th, 2020, via Qingyue Open Environmental Data Center, which publishes data of environmental quality. Daily (24-h) average concentrations of air quality index (AQI), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub>2</sub>), maximum 8-h average ozone (O
 <sub>3</sub>), particulate matter with diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>) and particulate matter with diameters ≤10 μm (PM
 <sub>10</sub>) were calculated. Besides, we collected the air pollution data of past few years from 2016 to 2020 in 367 major cities of China from the monthly reports of Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People’ s Republic of China (
