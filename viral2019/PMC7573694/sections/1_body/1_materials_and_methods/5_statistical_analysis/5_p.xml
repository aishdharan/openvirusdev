<p id="p0085">For the time-series analyses, Poisson regression models within GAMs were performed which were data-driven method designed to estimate the non-linear relation between explanative factors and dependent variables. Briefly, the model was demonstrated as follows:
 <disp-formula id="ufd1">Log [E(Y
  <sub>t,i</sub>)] = α + β × pollutant
  <sub>i</sub> + s (date
  <sub>t</sub>, df
  <sub>1</sub>) + log [(Y
  <sub>t-1,i</sub>)+ 1] + s (temperature
  <sub>t,i</sub>, df
  <sub>2</sub>) + dewpoint temperature
  <sub>t,i</sub> + dow
  <sub>t</sub> + lockdown
  <sub>t</sub> + city
  <sub>i</sub>
 </disp-formula>
