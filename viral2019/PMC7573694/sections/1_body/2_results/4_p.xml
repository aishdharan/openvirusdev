<p id="p0120">To show the joint distribution of daily confirmed and deaths cases and air pollutants, time-series heatmaps and line charts were used to plot the concentrations of air pollutants and new confirmed cases and deaths outside Hubei respectively. A timeline of control measures during the COVID-19 epidemics were added to visualize the contrast of air pollution and cases (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). On Jan. 23rd, the travel restriction and some other control measures were declared in Hubei, and a few days later in other province. All the provinces began Level 1 response of public health emergency on Jan. 29th. During the quarantine (From Jan. 23rd to Mar. 11th), most regions witnessed substantial diminution of ambient air pollutants except for O
 <sub>3</sub>. The AQI decreased by 12.7%, and five air pollutants (ie. PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, SO
 <sub>2</sub> and CO) decreased by 13.4%, 19.4%, 43.1%, 15.9%, 10.8%, respectively. There was an obvious valley point for most regions from Feb. 14th to Feb. 17th. The concentration of air pollutants after quarantine were well below the China national air quality standards (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). Moreover, we compared the ambient air pollution of winter in 367 major Chinese cities from 2016 to 2020 and a decline was shown since 2017 except PM
 <sub>10</sub> and O
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). However, 8-h average daily maximum concentration of O
 <sub>3</sub> showed a rising trend during the study period, increased by 32.9%. On Feb. 15th, work resumption was taken place nationwide except Hubei, and on Mar. 4th, most provinces downgraded the emergency response to Level 2. Since there was a change of case definition, Hubei Province were not showed here.
