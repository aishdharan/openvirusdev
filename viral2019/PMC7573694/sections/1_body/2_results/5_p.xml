<p id="p0125">Relative risk (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) of air pollutants (per IQR increase) for COVID-19 new confirmed cases in single-lag models were presented in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2</xref> The largest effect were found on lag 0–15 for AQI (RR, 1.09; 95%CI, 1.06–1.12), PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> (RR, 1.07; 95%CI, 1.04–1.09), and PM
 <sub>10</sub> (RR, 1.06; 95%CI, 1.03–1.08) respectively and such effects diminished along the time gradually. However, the association of NO
 <sub>2</sub> and COVID-19 infection didn’t reach the top until lag 0–20 (RR 1.19; 95%CI 1.13–1.24), while the effects of rest gaseous pollutants (CO, SO
 <sub>2</sub>, O
 <sub>3</sub>) remained negative and reach summit on lag 0–25 with RR of 0.82(95%CI: 0.80–0.83), 0.81(95%CI: 0.78–0.85), and 0.82 (95%CI: 0.78–0.85) respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). In sensitivity analysis, the association between COVID-19 confirmed cases of report date and air pollution was shown (

 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref> demonstrated the association which was additionally adjusted of wind speed and the result was quite stable.
