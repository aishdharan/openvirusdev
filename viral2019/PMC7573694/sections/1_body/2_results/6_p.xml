<p id="p0130">The stratified estimation by seven distinguished areas were showed in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. In middle south, southwest and northwest of China, six air pollutants reached the largest effects on lag 0–25 which were not in accordance with the overall lag effects. And the effects of all gaseous pollution except for O
 <sub>3</sub> in northeastern China showed the top on lag 0–20. In the eastern, the effects of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and NO
 <sub>2</sub> went through a transition from negative to positive and that of CO and SO
 <sub>2</sub> remained negative with the decrease of RRs. In the northern, we saw an increase on association between concentrations of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, SO
 <sub>2</sub> and CO and COVID-19 new cases resulting in the largest effects on lag 0–25. Besides, the significantly negative effect of O
 <sub>3</sub> went summit on lag 0–25 in middle south, east and northwest part of China. However, no evident trend of air-pollutant effects in Hubei was found.
