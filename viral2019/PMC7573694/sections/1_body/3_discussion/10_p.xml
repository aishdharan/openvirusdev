<p id="p0175">Thus, the ambient air pollution would have effect on COVID-19 morbidity and the quarantine measures could decline the concentration of gaseous pollutants inversely. Our multicity time-series analysis provided evidence on positive associations between short-term exposure of air pollutants (AQI, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>) and daily new COVID-19 confirmed cases. The negative relations between CO, SO
 <sub>2</sub>, O
 <sub>3</sub> and coronavirus require further validation. Besides, we introduced the ten lag days from onset date to report date which helped to reveal the true lag effects for those air pollutants (

 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and NO
 <sub>2</sub> might be postponed to 10 days later while those of O
 <sub>3</sub> might be considered 10 days ahead and the largest association of SO
 <sub>2</sub> and CO would be underestimated if neglecting the report-date lag. The association of new confirmed of report date and air pollution was shown in sensitivity analysis. In addition, the adjustments for lockdown and a range of confounders at the city level were considered.
