<p id="p0135">This multicenter, time-series study demonstrated positive associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants (NO
 <sub>2</sub>, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>) with daily new COVID-19 confirmed cases via GAM, in which the lag from onset date to report date were taken into account. However, the concentrations of CO, SO
 <sub>2</sub>, and O
 <sub>3</sub> were negatively associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Furthermore, the stringent prevention and control measures intending to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, contributed to a significant decline in concentration of air pollutants except O
 <sub>3</sub>. And the decline of air pollution inversely protected against the transmission and invasion of coronavirus virus. Our stratified analysis showed differed associations in different geographic regions, which could be explained by the interaction effect of air pollution and spread of COVID-19.
