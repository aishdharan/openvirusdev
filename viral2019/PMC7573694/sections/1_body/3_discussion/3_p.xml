<p id="p0140">Besides, we introduced lag effects between the COVID-19 onset date and report date. The median incubation period of coronavirus was 5.1 days as reported (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lauer et al., 2020</xref>) and the confirmation by nucleic acid test would cost several days which impacted the prompt confirmation of COVID-19 new onset cases. The largest lag effects of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and NO
 <sub>2</sub> were postponed to 10 days later and the lag of O
 <sub>3</sub> was considered ten days ahead of the highest effect neglecting the report-date lag. Moreover, the largest association of SO
 <sub>2</sub> and CO would be underestimated. The association of new confirmed of report date and air pollution was shown in sensitivity analysis (
