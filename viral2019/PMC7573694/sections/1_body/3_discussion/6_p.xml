<p id="p0155">Our results suggested that exposure to ambient NO
 <sub>2</sub> may contribute to the spread of COVID-19. For per IQR increase in NO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration
 <sub>,</sub> about 19% increase in COVID-19 morbidity were observed, with a lag of 20 days. Among all NO
 <sub>2</sub> sources, motor vehicle emission and energy production are the most important. A systematic review confirmed that short-term increases in concentration of NO
 <sub>2</sub>, were associated with increases in hospital admissions due to pneumonia (

 <sub>2</sub> is an irritant of the respiratory system, and it has been verified that increases in viral clinical symptoms related to NO
 <sub>2</sub> may due to the possible NO
 <sub>2</sub> effects on host defenses that prevent the spread of virus (

 <sub>x</sub> were associated with prolonged exacerbations of likely viral etiology, which might increase susceptibility to infection (
