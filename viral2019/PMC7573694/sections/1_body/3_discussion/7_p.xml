<p id="p0160">In the analysis of CO, SO
 <sub>2</sub> and O
 <sub>3</sub>, protective effects were observed, which lowered the morbidity risk for 18%, 19%, 18% per IQR increase respectively, different from some previous findings (

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Yet prior studies have given some evidence suggesting a protective role of low-concentration exposure of gaseous pollution on respiratory diseases as well as asthma (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>;

 <sub>2</sub> and maximum 8-h average O
 <sub>3</sub> were below the China national air pollution standard of 4 mg/m
 <sup>3</sup>, 50 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup> and 100 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively. However, we speculated that confounders especially control measures during pandemic period might still play a major role. Besides, during the outbreak of COVID-19, the new confirmed cases rocketed while the concentrations of air pollutants dived with the strict national lockdown. The authentic association might be overwhelmed by the overspread epidemic situation if the relations were tiny enough due to the statistical defect that multi risk factors could not be explained.
