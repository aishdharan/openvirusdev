<p id="p0185">Our study finds that there is a significant decline in the concentrations of air pollutants except O
 <sub>3</sub> during COVID-19 quarantine, and the association between air pollution and the spread of COVID-19 is statistically significant. Short-term exposure to air pollutants, including PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, may contribute to an increase in the counts of daily onset cases. Our analysis provides quantitative assessments regarding links between air quality, COVID-19 and the quarantine measures, suggesting that stringent prevention and control measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the virus spread by reducing air pollution, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19. This study may serve as a reference to better understand the factors affecting the diffusion and transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings suggest that ambient air quality should be attached more importance to, as it would reduce the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Thus, since resumption of work, production and activities has taken place in some regions, the significance of environmental protection should also be paid close attention to. An integrated strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 should be designed not only in medicine and health term, but also in terms of sustainability science and environmental science.
