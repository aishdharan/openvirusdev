<p>Viruses, the living dead, are the greatest villains in a “no man's land” although they are also vehicles of gene transfer and can thereby promote host evolution. For millions of years, we have been at war with these zombie particles along with other pathogens. It is not just our naïve immune systems that learn lessons from the pathogens - they learn from us too. Viruses, particularly RNA viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and SARS-CoV-2 as well as influenza A and B, have extraordinary abilities to mutate, changing their genes and thereby jumping the species barrier to expand their range of victims. RNA viruses do so at much greater rates than DNA viruses [
