<p>Eating habits of humans have not only caused preventable epidemics but they have caused an array of ailments in every one of our body systems [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lăcătușu et al., 2019</xref>]. Certainly we eat far more animal products than is good for us, and consuming much less meat of better quality from sustainable sources is highly recommended by most nutritionists and environmentalists. Plants, fungi, and bacteria have all the good things nature has to offer us, and there may be good reasons why these organisms seem to lack pain receptors. Major religious, philosophical, cultural. and scientific groups around the world are convinced that we should respect animal life, but animals are still slaughtered for the food eaten by billions of people. Western nations use stunning methods (the bolt, gassing, and electrocution) so that the animal is unable to display outward signs of pain, but we cannot prove that the stunned animal does not suffer [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aghwan and Regenstein, 2019</xref>]. When an animal is slaughtered with a cut to their neck without stunning, they are believed to feel pain for 12–90 s, depending on the size of the animal. But this is not really known, and there is no truly humane way to kill a sensitive animal.
