<p>SARS spread to 29 countries around the world in 8 months, infecting about 8,100 people, with a fatality rate of ∼15%. MERS infected 2,494 people in 27 countries, with a fatality rate of roughly 35%. Covid-19 cases exceeded 5.5 million as of May 25, 2020, spreading from a very few cases to this number in just over 4 months. The initial fatality rate (fatalities/cases) in China was ∼6%, although this rate has declined as the disease has spread throughout China, and then worldwide, in part, because health care professionals learned how to deal more effectively with the disease. Nevertheless, fatalities are still occurring at a high rate, with over 4,000 deaths reported per day worldwide. Thus, although the fatality rate from Covid-19 (in percentages of cases) is less than those due to SARS and MERS, the transmission rate between humans seems to be far greater than for the other 2 human respiratory coronavirus diseases, with about 100,000 new cases reported per day.</p>
