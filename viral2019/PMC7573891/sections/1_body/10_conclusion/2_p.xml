<p>There has been extensive research on animal CoVs in veterinary medicine. The pathogenicity and evolution of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in poultry, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cats, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in swine, to mention a few, have been known in veterinary medicine since the beginning of the twentieth century [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Decaro et al., 2020</xref>]. Studies of animal coronaviruses have provided evidence as to how these viruses evolve, changing tissue tropism and virulence and crossing the species barriers to infect new hosts [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Decaro et al., 2020</xref>]. Swine TGEV likely originated from the related canine coronavirus (CCoV) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Lorusso et al., 2009</xref>]; the less virulent porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) may then have originated from TGEV, and a TGEV-like CCoV may have been generated by a nucleic acid recombination event, changing the N-terminus of the viral S protein [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Decaro et al., 2009</xref>]. The Î²-coronaviral porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) was a derivative of a bovine coronavirus, which, in turn, is believed to have evolved from a bat virus, adapted to a rodent species [
