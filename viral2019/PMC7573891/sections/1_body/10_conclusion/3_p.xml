<p>We can expect far more serious epidemics and pandemics in the near future, as many viral and other pathogenic vectors are made homeless due to the loss of virtually all wild animals, resulting from hunting, deforestation, environmental degradation, and anthropization. Human consumption of wild animals has enormously increased the risk of selecting for viral mutations and genetic recombination in the viral genome, allowing adaptation to humans. Slaughtering of wild animals and consumption of endangered animals should be banned altogether and strictly enforced around the world. Illegal sales of exotic wild animals and their meat are prevalent, even in the USA, and these practices may become sources of future epidemics. The lack of resources to allow testing and inspections and an increased appetite for exotic meat, coupled with economic affluence, is allowing the illegal trade of endangered wild animals to continue, especially in developed countries. With increasing globalization, greater mixing of populations between cities and towns worldwide, and the high transmissibility of viruses within high-density populations, it is not surprising that we can expect unprecedented human catastrophes.</p>
