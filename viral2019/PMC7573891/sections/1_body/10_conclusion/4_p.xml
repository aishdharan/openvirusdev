<p>Undoubtedly, Covid-19 will not be the last one. We can only hope that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will increase our awareness of emerging viruses so we can take necessary precautions by curbing our craving for exotic meat and discover the rich nutrients in the varieties of seeds, leaves, vegetables, and fruits of the plant world. No known epidemic has resulted from the transmission of a plant virus to an animal. We do not all have to become vegans, but we can easily become predominant vegetarians as appears to have been characteristic of most of our early ancestors. And if we do, we shall live healthier and longer quality lives.</p>
