<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs), associated with the respiratory, enteric, and nervous systems of birds, mammals, and humans, were believed to cause only occasional lower respiratory infections and pneumonia until we encountered SARS-CoV in 2002. A decade after the SARS epidemic, in 2012, a novel corona virus appeared in Saudi Arabia and was designated the MERS. Overall, it had a higher fatality rate (âˆ¼35%) than SARS. Bats were again found to have provided initial reservoirs of MERS-CoV, but humans were most likely infected through an intermediate host, possibly the camel [

The intermediate hosts have been mostly confined to Middle Eastern regions, and this virus may have a lower human-to-human transmission rate, which could explain the lower pandemic potential of MERS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV.
