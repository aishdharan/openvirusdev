<p>The current (May 25, 2020) COVID-19 pandemic, with over 5.5 million cases worldwide and an estimated overall fatality rate of 16% (deaths/recoveries), and one-third of all cases with an almost 2-fold higher fatality rate occurring in the USA, was and is caused by a novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV and therefore called SARS-CoV-2 or merely CoV-2. The appearance of this novel virus provides a clear indication that mutations in SARS-like coronaviruses, circulating in bat and other animal populations around the world, threaten to cause more severe pandemics in the future [

Since there is no currently effective treatment or vaccine for any of these coronaviral diseases, even after 18 years of research on SARS, we can anticipate that cures and vaccines for this new virus will not be easily or quickly developed. Newly appearing viruses of this and other types are likely to adapt to humans in the future as the populations of all wild animals decrease, while the human population continues to increase and disturb the natural populations of CoV-carrying animals [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fung et al., 2020</xref>]. Because the viral spike (S) protein that binds the cell surface human receptor, i.e., the ACE2 protein, is important for species and organ specificity, it may prove to be the most important viral protein against which an antibody vaccine will be developed.
