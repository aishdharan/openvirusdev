<p>The Marburg virus (MARV), like the Ebola virus, is an enveloped RNA filovirus that causes hemorrhagic fever, a fatally infectious disease [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Shifflett and Marzi, 2019</xref>]. Marburg virus disease is another zoonotic disease that is known to persist in a healthy reservoir identified as the Egyptian fruit bat (
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic>). Like the Ebola virus, it infects nonhuman primates as well as humans. The first known human infections were identified in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, as well as in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia), in 1967. The source of infection was traced to an African green monkey, i.e.,

Once again, contact with and/or ingestion of wild animal meat appears to have been responsible for transmission of the virus to the human population. Given the high rates of mutation that these viruses exhibit, it seems likely that alteration or expansion of a virus's host range, allowing recognition of different receptors on a host cell surface, probably was responsible for the shift. It follows that such alterations could result in novel pandemics in the future.
