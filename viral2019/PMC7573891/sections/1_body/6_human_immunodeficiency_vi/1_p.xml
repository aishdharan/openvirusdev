<p>Human immunodeficiency viruses, types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), which cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), are RNA-enveloped lentiviruses. They infect humans through cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) from other primates [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Sharp and Hahn, 2011</xref>]. SIVcpz was believed to have transferred to humans as a result of chimps (
 <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>, our closest primate relative) being killed and eaten by humans, but if chimp blood is exposed to cuts and other wounds on the people hunting these animals, the virus can also be transmitted without ingestion [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Sharp and Hahn, 2011</xref>]. HIV-2 is believed to have come from SIVsmm of the sooty mangabey (
 <italic>Cercocebus atys</italic>), an Old World monkey, found in the forests of Senegal as well as in a margin along the African coast [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1997</xref>]. Thus, transmission to humans probably occurred primarily in the same way, through butchering and consumption of monkey meat. African markets are known to have increased the supply of bush meat whenever fish supplies dwindled and, although the consumption of bush meat is illegal in many African countries, this regulation is difficult to enforce. Thus, the action continues at a very significant risk to the human populations in this region of the world. Of course, once infectious in a human, the virus can be spread by the transfer of bodily fluids between people.
