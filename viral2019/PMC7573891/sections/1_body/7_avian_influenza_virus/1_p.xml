<p>Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by inÂ­fection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) type A viruses (AIV-A). These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry as well as wild birds and other animal species including humans. Avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans, but sporadic human infections caused by these viruses have been reported [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Song and Qin, 2020</xref>]. AIV is also known as H5N1, and this virus has killed billions of poultry in Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. Most recently, it has been found in virtually all countries of the world. It kills between 36 and 60% of all infected humans and thus has one of the highest case fatality rates.
