<p>Cases of H5N1 infections in people were not known until 2017, but transmission to humans is attributed to the fact that the surface proteins of the virus can change due to mutations in the structural genes encoding these proteins. Mutations generate viral forms that are capable of recognizing different host receptors. These viruses aggressively infect domestic birds, wild ducks and geese, and other aquatic and migratory birds, spreading the disease around the world, evolving through ongoing mutation and natural selection. These viruses continue to evolve and adapt to multiple reservoir hosts, including humans, and they pose major threats globally to the poultry industry as well as to people [

Like swine influenza virus, discussed in the next section, the continuous recombination of viral RNA, going on in our huge domestic flocks and herds, explains why we need to keep making new vaccines each year, and why international cooperation in monitoring the emergence of new strains is so important. This example illustrates why we should scale down meat consumption and pay farmers more per animal raised, thus allowing them to provide space to minimize overcrowding.
