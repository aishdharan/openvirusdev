<p>China's swine farms are reported to serve as “mixing bowls” for novel influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Shortridge et al., 1977</xref>]. China is home to some of the largest pig farms in the world, with semi-fenced houses, allowing crowds of wild birds to seek food in the pig pens. Dense populations of humans, pigs, and poultry, all living in close proximity, enable birds carrying avian influenza virus (AIV) to infect pigs and occupational swine-exposed workers [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Shu et al., 1996</xref>]. An extensive 5-year molecular and immunologic study of 6 Chinese pig farms revealed that a number of swine and human-infected influenza A viruses, similar to A(H1N1)pdm09-like viruses, were circulating in farms and moving back and forth between humans and pigs [
