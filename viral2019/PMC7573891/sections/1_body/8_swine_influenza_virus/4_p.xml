<p>Since the first global epidemic nearly 50 years ago, H1N1 and its reassorted serotypes killed thousands of people around the world, but it is believed that the “Spanish flu” pandemic of 1918 was caused by an H1N1-like virus of mammalian origin that acquired the hemagglutinin gene from an AIV. However, a bacterial pneumonia, caused by

The Hong Kong pandemic of 1968 occurred with the emergence of influenza A (H3N2), which is a hybrid strain that evolved from H2N2, through an antigenic shift, where several subtypes reassorted to form the new virus. The Hong Kong virus came to the USA in 1968, and similar viruses returned in 1970 and 1972, causing over 100,000 deaths. The 1957 Asian flu, the 1968 Hong Kong flu, and the 1977 Russian flu all originated in China [
