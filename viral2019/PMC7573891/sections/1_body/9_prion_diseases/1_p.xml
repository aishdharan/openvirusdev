<p>Prion diseases generally are believed to have arisen from rare, zoonotic, transmissible protein mutations. A prion protein can fold in 2 ways, i.e., into a normal form and a prion form. The prion protein can then influence other similar proteins to fold into the prion form. Patients develop aggressive personality changes, memory loss, problems walking, and other often fatal neurodegenerative disorders, some of which are known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. These diseases affect humans and animals, and they include scrapie (in sheep), chronic wasting disease (CWD in deer and elk), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE in cattle), and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD in humans). Prion diseases can be inherited due to germ-line mutations in various genes, including the gene encoding the PRNP protein, and it can be acquired through infection with animal or human prions via various routes.</p>
