<p>As noted above, scrapie is a prion disease in sheep, first reported in 1732 in the UK; it had a devastating effect on the wool industry, but no known human infections resulted by transfer from the sheep. In the early 1900s, cattle feed manufacturers started supplying farmers who fed their cows with meat bone meal made with discarded bones and internal organs of slaughtered cows and sheep. Farmers in other European countries and the USA soon adopted this practice as it increased the growth rates of the animals. This may have been the origin of BSE, first, involving the spread of this prion disease from sheep to cattle and, second, promoting the spread of the disease throughout the cattle industry.</p>
