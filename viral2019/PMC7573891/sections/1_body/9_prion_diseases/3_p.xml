<p>BSE is a chronic degenerative disease in cows, transforming their brains into “sponges” with neurotic symptoms and paralysis, ultimately leading to death. The World Organization for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties; OIE) reported 190,628 BSE cases in 25 countries worldwide in August 30, 2012. In the UK, more than 184,000 cases of BSE have been reported, and more than a million cows were destroyed to stop the spread of the disease [
