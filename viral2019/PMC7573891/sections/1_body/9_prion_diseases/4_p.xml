<p>It was not suspected that BSE would cross the species barrier and infect humans, but a human variant of BSV was first recognized in 1996 and it was designated variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which is also known as the human form of mad cow disease. Between 1980 and 2000 in the UK and much of Europe, beef consumption was considered risky, fearing a doomsday scenario of mass dementia. BSE appeared first in 1984, and by 1987 scientists had discovered that animal carcasses turned into cattle feed were responsible for the disease. The British Government banned contaminated cow meat and enforced strict safety rules, which saved millions of lives of beef eaters worldwide. Much later, the causative agent was identified as a misfolded self-propagating, posttranslationally modified protein by Stanley Prusinar at the University of California, San Francisco, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1997.</p>
