<p>Prion proteins in infected animals are concentrated in the brain, eyes, spinal cord, skull, vertebral column, tonsils, and Payer patches of the small intestine. These regions of the body are called “specific risk material.” The amount of this risk material required to induce the disease is very small, i.e., as small as a speck of pepper [
