<p id="Par17">Sichuan province is in the interior of Southwest China, adjacent to Yunnan and Guizhou in the South and Tibet in the West. Sichuan has a population of approximately 85 million people, and is a developing area in China. Since the initial HIV epidemic was fueled by IDU in 1990s, the HIV epidemic in Sichuan had become one of the worst in China. By 2018, there were 132, 680 HIV infections reported in Sichuan province, which ranked the first among all provinces/autonomous regions in China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in Liangshan prefecture in Sichuan, and reported that the infected IDUs in this region could serve as a source of transmission to other regions of China [
