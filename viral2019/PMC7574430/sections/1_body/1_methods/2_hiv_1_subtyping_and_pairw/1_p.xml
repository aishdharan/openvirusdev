<p id="Par20">HIV subtypes were assessed by phylogenetic analysis. The HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were aligned with reference sequences of various subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) from Los Alamos HIV sequence database (LANL,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with minor manual adjustments. FastTree 2.3 was used to estimate an approximately-maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree for 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences using the GTR + G + I nucleotide substitution model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The phylogenetic tree’s reliability was determined with local support values based on the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and presented using FigTree v1.4.3 (
