<p id="Par26">Of the 1291 available sequences in the molecular epidemiological surveillance of Sichuan in 2019, CRF07_BC (676/1291, 52.36%), CRF01_AE (341/1291, 26.41%), CRF08_BC (114/1291, 8.83%), and CRF85_BC (68/1291, 5.27%) were the 4 most epidemic strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). CRF85_BC dominated the HIV-1 epidemics in Yibin (58/146), a southeast city in Sichuan Province, and was also detected in Luzhou (4/174), Leshan (3/120), Chengdu (2/312) and Mianyang (1/70) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Compare with the data of Sichuan molecular epidemiological surveillance in 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the proportion of CRF85_BC in Sichuan increased from 3.66% (14/383) to 5.27%, and it became more widely distributed. To further understand whether CRF85_BC was involved in ongoing transmission, we examined the sequence diversity by estimating pairwise distances between sequences in 2014(
 <italic>n</italic> = 14) and sequences in 2019(
 <italic>n</italic> = 68). We detected a much more diversity in 2019 (mean distance 0.023, SD 0.002) compared with 2014 (mean distance 0.010, SD 0.001), supporting an ongoing evolution of CRF85_BC overtime.
