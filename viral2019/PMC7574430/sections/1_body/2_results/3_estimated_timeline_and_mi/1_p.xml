<p id="Par28">To elucidate the sources and dissemination routes of endemic CRF85_BC geographically, we constructed maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree based on 149 Sichuan sequences and 15 sequences from other provinces in China using Bayesian geographical evolution method. The corresponding median coefficient of rate variation was 0.33(95% highest posterior density (HPD): 0.18–0.49), supporting the selection of a relaxed molecular clock model. Both Bayesian skyline plot and Bayesian skygrid analysis showed that HIV-1 CRF85_BC experienced 2 fast growth phases during 2011–2014 and 2017–2019 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) with a mean growth rate of 2.5*10
 <sup>− 3</sup> per year [95% HPD: 2.0*10
 <sup>− 3</sup> - 3.0*10
 <sup>− 3</sup>]. The tMRCA was inferred to be 2005.4 (95% HPD: 2002.3–2007.9), implying the origin time of the CRF85_BC (Table
