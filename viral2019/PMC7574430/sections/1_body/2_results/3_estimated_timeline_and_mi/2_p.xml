<p id="Par29">The MCC tree showed that CRF85_BC from Yunnan were located at the root of the tree (posterior probability (PP = 1). Sequentially, virus spread form Yunnan to Sichuan (PP = 0.9911), Guangxi (PP = 0.9978), and other regions. The first place of the viral introduction into Sichuan was probably Yibin in 2008.6 (2006.7–2010.2). An explosive outbreak was then found in the heterosexual elderly people in this city. Several small clusters further suggested that the virus became epidemic in many cities of Sichuan (Luzhou, Guangyuan, et al.) and had rapidly spread to other provinces (such as Liaoning, Anhui and Chongqing) (Fig.
