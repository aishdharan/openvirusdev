 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], over 66.5% circulating HIV strains in Sichuan were defined as CRF_BC including CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and CRF85_BC et al. Hence, CRF_BC infections became a more serious public health issue, which necessitated a deeper understanding of the CRF_BC epidemic patterns in China. CRF85_BC, a newly identified CRF_BC, were the fourth most prevalent HIV strains (68/1291, 5.27%) in Sichuan and was dominating the HIV-1 epidemic in a southwestern city, i e. Yibin city.
