<p id="Par32">In the present study, we only found CRF85_BC prevalent in heterosexually infected individuals. In molecular epidemiological surveillance of Sichuan in 2019, 64.7% of CRF85_BC were transmission via commercial sex. Other early studies about CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC suggested that CRF_BC had spread from IDU to the general population by sexual transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, commercial sex transmission was at least an important driving factor of CRF85_BC becoming endemic in some local areas. Notably, the majority of cases infected by CRF85_BC were PLHIV50+ cases, most of whom were low-educated. PLHIV50+ have been significantly increasing in the past two decades globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The proportion of PLHIV50+ around the world increased substantially from 8% in 2000 to 16% in 2016 and is expected to reach an estimated 21% by 2020 [
