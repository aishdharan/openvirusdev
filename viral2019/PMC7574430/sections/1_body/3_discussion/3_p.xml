<p id="Par33">Analysis of 148 PR/RT sequences from CRF85_BC infected individuals sampled between 2011 and 2019 revealed that this strain had not just become endemic in Sichuan but also spread to some other provinces in China. Until now, at least 6 provinces have been affected and had a most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) is estimated at around 2005. Yunnan is considered to be the origin area. Previous studies in Yunnan between 2009 and 2012 revealed several CRF_BC HIV-1 strains circulating among local sexually active youth, which is coincident with the gateway position of Yunnan in China’s HIV epidemic history [
