<p id="Par34">CRF85_BC dispersion showed a strong geographic compartmentalization. After its origin in Yunnan, CRF85_BC almost at the same time spread to neighboring provinces such as Sichuan around 2008.6 (2006.7–2010.2), Guangxi around 2012.3 (2011.3–2013.2). The first place where the virus was introduced into Sichuan was probably Yibin city, which was located in the junction of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan Provinces. In recent years, the local epidemic situation had deteriorated rapidly [

The explosive epidemic of CRF85_BC was found in the heterosexual elderly people in this city, and 39.7% (58/146) HIV cases locally were infected by CRF85_BC. Phylogeographical reconstruction further suggested that CRF85_BC spread from Yibin to other cities of Sichuan and even other provinces. This virus was identified in 9 cities in Sichuan, 3 of which probably had an endemic, such Luzhou, Leshan and Guangyuan. Leshan and Luzhou were both bordering with Yibin. Guangyuan is a northeastern city in Sichuan. According to another research, CRF85_BC infected people with Yibin household registration travelled to and resided in Guangyuan, further adding fuel to local endemic.
