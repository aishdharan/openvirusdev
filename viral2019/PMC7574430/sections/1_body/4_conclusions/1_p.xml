<p id="Par36">Our study is the first report to clarify the phylogeographic and demographic dynamics of CRF 85_BC, a newly-identified and increasingly prevalent HIV-1 strain, in Sichuan, China. This study also highlights that heterosexual behavior among older people played an important role in the contribution of CRF 85_BC transmission. The origin of CRF 85_BC was traced back to Yunnan around 2005, spread exponentially to various places (including Guangxi, Sichuan, et al), and later on became endemic around 2008.5 (2007.0â€“2010.5) in Sichuan. Our findings provide novel insights into the dissemination of a novel HIV-1 virus and extend the understanding of the HIV epidemic in China.</p>
