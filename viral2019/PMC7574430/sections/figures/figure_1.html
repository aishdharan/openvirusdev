 <caption> The distribution of CRF85_BC from Sichuan in 2019. a Phylogenetic analysis of pol sequences from Sichuan in 2019. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the approximately-maximum-likelihood method based on the pol region (HXB2: 2, 253 to 3, 312 nt) in FastTree 2.3. The nucleotide substitution mode was GTR + G + I. The subtypes and circulating recombinant forms are marked in different colors. The bootstrap value is indicated at relevant nodes. HIV-1 group O was chosen as an out-group in the rooted tree. The reference sequences from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database ( http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/content/index). b The demographic distribution of CRF85_BC in Sichuan. Number of reported cases in different prefectures in Sichuan based on the molecular epidemiological surveillance of Sichuan in 2019 </caption>
