   <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Sichuan in 2019. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the approximately-maximum-likelihood method based on the 
   <italic>pol</italic> region (HXB2: 2, 253 to 3, 312 nt) in FastTree 2.3. The nucleotide substitution mode was GTR + G + I. The subtypes and circulating recombinant forms are marked in different colors. The bootstrap value is indicated at relevant nodes. HIV-1 group O was chosen as an out-group in the rooted tree. The reference sequences from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (
