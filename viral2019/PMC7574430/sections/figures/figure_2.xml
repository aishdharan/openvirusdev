  <p>Prevalence and demographic history of CRF85_BC in Sichuan. 
   <bold>a</bold> The Bayesian skyline plot and Bayesian skygrid analysis of CRF85_BC. The Bayesian skyline plot and Bayesian skygrid analysis estimated the past population dynamics of CRF85_BC. The thick solid line in the plot represents the median estimate, and the shaded region represents the 95% HPD credible region. 
   <bold>b</bold> The MCC tree of CRFF85_BC. The MCC tree was constructed based a data set of 148 CRF85_BC pol region (HXB2: 2, 253 to 3, 312 nt) using Bayesian MCMC analysis implemented in BEAST v 1.8.4. The analysis was performed using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model in GTR + I + G4 nucleotide substitution model under an exponential coalescent model. The MCMC analysis was run for 200 million generations, with sampling every 20,000 generations. The different color branches indicate the strains from different areas, respectively. Sichuan-CD (Chengdu), Sichuan-LS (Leshan), Sichuan-GA (Guangan), Sichuan-GY (Guangyuan), Sichuan-LZ (Luzhou), Sichuan-MY (Mianyang), Sichuan-MS (Meishan), Sichuan-SN (Suining), Sichuan-YB (Yibin)
