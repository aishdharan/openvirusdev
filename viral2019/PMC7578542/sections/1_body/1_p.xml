<p id="p0030">A typical year in the United States (US) has 9 to 45 million influenza infections resulting in 140,000 to 810,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 61,000 deaths [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Each year several characteristics factor into the morbidity and mortality rates of the influenza virus, including the virulence of the dominant virus, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccine utilization. Increased vaccinations result in decreased morbidity and mortality rates [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the US, the COVID-19 virus has infected 7,689,358 Americans resulting in 214,007 deaths as of October 10, 2020 [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both viruses, while from different families, result in fever, cough, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue [

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. Risk factors for both viruses for severe disease include increasing age, prior comorbid conditions, cardiac and pulmonary diseases, and immunocompromised status [

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The notable exception is the influenza virusâ€™ unique predilection for younger children [
