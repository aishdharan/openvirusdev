<p id="p0050">In order to increase influenza vaccination rates in the US, public policy should be constructed to strongly support the vaccination of those working or attending school in public spaces. Such a public policy would resemble current healthcare institutions' policies on employee mandates for influenza vaccination, as it has been recognized healthcare workersâ€™ role in spreading the viral illness. This approach may include mass advertising of important public health information via official social media platforms and infomercials. Additionally, due to the increased use of telemedicine, physicians can opt to program a short information video on influenza and COVID-19, highlighting the importance of vaccination and proper hygiene prior to the start of the appointment. Building upon prior years of influenza vaccination education and increased public awareness of ILIs, physicians can help optimize public vigilance while having increased awareness themselves for signs of ILIs. Innovative approaches should be taken to reinforce and inform the US population on the need for proper hygiene as well as personal adjustments due to the current pandemic, which includes the use of face masks and social distancing.</p>
