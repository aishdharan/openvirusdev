<p>Gaps in the HIV care continuum, particularly between HIV diagnosis, linkage to HIV care, and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), present a persistent global public health challenge [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-07345" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Multiple medical advancements in HIV care aim to mitigate drop-off along the care continuum. Early ART, regardless of CD4 count, has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality among patients living with HIV [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-07345" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Universal test and treat strategies have been shown to reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HIV from virologically suppressed individuals to their sexual partners, also known as treatment as prevention [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-07345" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. At the same time, the advent of new potent antiretrovirals, including integrase inhibitors, have resulted in regimens that are easier to tolerate, with fewer drug–drug interactions, higher barriers to resistance, and more single-dose regimen options [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-07345" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These advances led to the exploration of rapid or immediate ART (iART)—defined as same-day, or as soon as possible after diagnosis, ART without waiting for initial bloodwork or viral resistance testing—as a potential approach to close the gap between HIV diagnosis, linkage to care, and ART initiation.
