<p>Emerging implementation approaches of iART in the US, like San Francisco’s Rapid ART Program Initiative for HIV Diagnoses (RAPID) model, have successfully condensed insurance acquisition, housing assessment, and mental health and substance use evaluation into an initial visit [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-07345" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, even the RAPID program, which serves a highly vulnerable patient population, can not explicitly address all psychosocial factors, such as structural racism, homophobia, HIV-related stigma, trauma, medical mistrust, and other important considerations present for patients at time of diagnosis. The HIV epidemic in the US is driven by significant disparities among racial/ethnic, gender, and sexual minorities [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-07345" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is a lack of evidence regarding how these patients perceive and experience iART, as well as iART’s impact on these aforementioned psychosocial factors. A more thorough examination of iART’s impact, particularly for the most vulnerable populations, is critical to meet the goals of ending the epidemic and to ensure that in addition to the universal, immediate offer of treatment, there is an appreciation of and targeted interventions for specific patient concerns. This commentary argues that a health equity approach that recognizes and intervenes upon the psychosocial forces impacting the most vulnerable populations living with HIV is vital for successful iART implementation and to avoid exacerbating disparities along the HIV care continuum.
