<p>Multiple international studies comparing same-day ART initiation to standard of care have found that same-day initiation was associated with improved viral suppression and retention in HIV care. The CASCADE trial from Lesotho found that a same-day home-based ART program compared to usual care resulted in significant increases in linkage to care at 3 months and viral suppression at 12 months [

In a study conducted in Haiti, Koenig et al. compared clinical outcomes in patients starting same-day ART to a control group initiating ART 3 weeks after diagnosis, with the composite primary outcome being retention in care with a suppressed viral load at 12 months [
