<p>Qualitative studies have provided a deeper understanding of concerns about iART for longer-term outcomes, particularly among vulnerable groups. While many qualitative studies in the global context have shown that patients find iART acceptable, some studies signal concerns. Helova et al. used in-depth interviews and focus groups to evaluate an Option B+ program (i.e., providing ART continuously starting in the pre-natal period) in Uganda and found that pregnant women living with HIV and their male partners more often than not accepted an iART approach, but at times felt uncomfortable with same-day initiation due to lack of time for diagnosis acceptance and discussion with family [

Similarly, Katirayi et al., in evaluating an Option B+ program in Malawi, showed pregnant women with HIV preferred to discuss their circumstances with their husbands prior to same-day initiation, and often wanted to check a CD4 count and repeat an HIV test at another facility to confirm their HIV status [

Maek-a-nantawat et al. assessed attitudes among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Thailand about iART pre- and post-HIV diagnosis and found some concerns about medication cost and side effects, as well as the concern that others would discover their diagnosis despite their high interest in iART [

These concerns do not mean there should be a return to the “patient readiness” model of the past, rather they call for a patient-centered approach that balances iART and its proven benefits (e.g., shorter time to viral load suppression) with an effort to empower patients to face the significant structural barriers to positive HIV care outcomes.
