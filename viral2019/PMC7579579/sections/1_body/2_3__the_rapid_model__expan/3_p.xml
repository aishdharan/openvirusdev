<p>Following the RAPID study, observational studies across the country have shown similar improvement in initial outcomes after iART. In a retrospective study, Hoenigl et al. showed that among newly diagnosed patients with HIV in San Diego, CA, those who initiated same-day ART were more likely to be virologically suppressed at 12 weeks [

It is important that these observational results have been replicated in different regions of the country, with racially and socioeconomically diverse patient populations. However, with iART becoming standard of care in many US jurisdictions, it is vital to understand how iART impacts the most vulnerable populations along the entire HIV care continuum, particularly given concerns about iART’s impact on long-term outcomes in the global context and potential emerging disparities in iART uptake among the RAPID cohort.
