<p>The HIV epidemic in the US is currently marked by significant disparities among racial/ethnic, gender, and sexual minorities. Out of the over 38,000 new HIV infections in 2017, 70% were among gay and bisexual men [

Among all MSM, Black MSM account for 37% of new HIV diagnoses, with growing concentration in the South, and fare worse at each step along the HIV care continuum (e.g., linkage, retention, and viral suppression) compared to their White counterparts [

Given that iART may quickly medicalize the post-diagnosis experience for some patients, potentially in advance of emotional processing, it is critical to understand iARTâ€™s impact in these communities to avoid the potential of emerging HIV-related health disparities. Consider, for example, that many well-intentioned major advancements in HIV prevention, care, and treatment (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), widespread testing, advances in antiretroviral treatment) have not improved racial disparities in HIV care outcomes. While improving time to viral suppression, iART has the potential to further racial disparities if not implemented with a deep understanding of how Black people living with HIV understand and perceive the iART intervention.
