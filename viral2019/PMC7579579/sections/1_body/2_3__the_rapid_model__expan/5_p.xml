<p>Major national clinical care guidelines from the US Department of Health and Human Services officially have endorsed an iART approach because of its clear benefits in achieving viral suppression more quickly [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-07345" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The current debate focuses on the optimal timing of ART—whether same-day, or “as soon as possible” is sufficient; however, the discussion should not ignore how iART may worsen disparities for vulnerable populations. We agree that a universal approach defined by immediate initiation is more optimal than a universal approach defined by the “readiness” models of the past. However, as we incorporate universal iART into clinical care delivery models, the specific concerns of the most marginalized groups (whether it be racism, HIV-related stigma, medical mistrust, health literacy, or other factors) should also be assessed and intervened upon. The RAPID model, upon which most US iART programs are based, addresses certain important structural and behavioral factors that drive disparities. However, it does not, to our knowledge, address some known psychosocial factors, including HIV-related stigma and medical mistrust at diagnosis, that disproportionately affect the groups disproportionately impacted by HIV. A health equity approach focused on allaying disparities will be integral to successful ongoing iART implementation for all patient populations in varied geographic contexts.
