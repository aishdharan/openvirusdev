<p>Little is known about the psychosocial costs and benefits of iART after diagnosis among racial/ethnic, gender, and sexual minorities. There is a substantial risk for exacerbating existing disparities if iART’s impact on the most vulnerable communities is not fully taken into account. HIV-related stigma, discrimination, and medical mistrust are some of the most significant barriers to care along the HIV care continuum for these populations. One can imagine that factors such as medication beliefs, health literacy, and other issues may also arise at time of diagnosis and further complicate an iART approach. In order to avoid further HIV-related disparities among racial, gender and sexual minorities, one must address these psychosocial factors in patients’ lives in the context of iART. </p>
