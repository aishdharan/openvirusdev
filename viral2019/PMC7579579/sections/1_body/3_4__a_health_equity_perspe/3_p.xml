<p>Following an HIV diagnosis, HIV-related stigma has a deleterious impact on HIV care engagement for minority patients. Turan et al. adapted the minority stress model to create a framework elucidating the multiple dimensions of HIV-related stigma at the individual level, including enacted (e.g., experienced discrimination), internalized (e.g., shame), anticipated (e.g., expectation of discrimination), and perceived (e.g., perception of stigmatized attitudes in the community) HIV stigma [

Immediate initiation may alleviate stigma and concern about one’s HIV status and empower patients through early integration of a new diagnosis. Alternatively, it may worsen ongoing stigma processes. Either way, mitigating stigma in its many dimensions must be considered to ensure iART’s successful implementation.
