<p>In a review of iART in 2019, Boyd et al. called for more high-quality studies to be conducted on iART in high-income countries and for an evaluation of its impact on patient empowerment [

Indeed, for programs that have not yet adopted iART, a randomized control trial evaluating clinical outcomes would help bolster the evidence base for iART as a proven intervention for the HIV care continuum in the US. In addition, implementation science studies will be vital to glean best practices as organizations move to an iART model in different clinical care delivery settings (e.g., large academic hospital clinics, community-based clinics, federally qualified health centers) with the goal of achieving health equity. Understanding how iART is operationalized (e.g., same-day visits, role of patient navigators) in different clinical contexts and what kinds of interventions have made a difference with at-risk populations will also provide important guidance. There is room for more tailored approaches depending on the context of different cities and states and their unique healthcare infrastructure (e.g., Medicaid expansion) and patient population needs (e.g., undocumented patients).
