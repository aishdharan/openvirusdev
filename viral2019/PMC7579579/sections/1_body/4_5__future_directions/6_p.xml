<p>In addition, there are potential theoretical frameworks that may help researchers incorporate a health equity lens into research focused on iART. For example, critical race theory may provide a basis for the qualitative exploration of the impact of structural racism on HIV diagnosis and immediate offer of treatment, and allow for targeted interventions in the context of iART [

In terms of implementation, there is also potential for the integration of screening tools at diagnosis to know which psychosocial issues to prioritize along with universal iART. Issues of stigma, mistrust, trauma, and low health literacy may be invisible to providers at time of diagnosis, thus an explicit exploration of how these structural issues affect iART for patients at the individual level provides an opportunity for a more targeted approach as we seek to end the HIV epidemic.
