As the US makes strides in decreasing overall HIV incidence, racial, gender, and sexual minorities bear a greater burden of HIV and experience poorer outcomes along the HIV care continuum. A health equity approach to iART is vital to its successful rollout and implementation, ensuring we close the gap along the HIV care continuum for the most marginalized people living with HIV. </p>
