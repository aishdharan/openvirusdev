 <p>Background</p>
 <p>Deep neck space infections (DNSIs) in children may lead to airway compromise and damage to the great vessels in the neck. They occur more commonly in the HIV-infected population. To our knowledge, this is the first case series of DNSI in HIV-infected children</p>
 <p>Objectives</p>
 <p>The aim of this study was to describe the demography and document the sites of infection; organisms identified and resistance patterns in HIV-infected children with DNSI.</p>
 <p>Methods</p>
 <p>We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of children (&lt;16 years) diagnosed with deep neck infections at the teaching hospitals for the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University of the Witwatersrand, between January 2010 and December 2018.</p>
 <p>Results</p>
 <p>We identified 17 patients with DNSI of which six children had concomitant HIV infection. The average age at presentation was six years (range: 0.35-13 years); there were four males and two females. The most common site involved was the submandibular space, which was affected in four patients. The detected organisms included: Coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Streptococcus viridans, Prevotella, Proteus mirabilis and Bacteroides fragilis. The organisms were universally resistant to penicillin and ampicillin resistance was documented in all but one patient.</p>
 <p>Conclusion</p>
 <p>Our findings on microbiology, resistance and tuberculosis culture are significant even in the face of a small series and have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of DNSI in HIV-infected children. Tuberculosis should routinely be considered in high burden settings. We recommend the empiric use of a β‐lactamase-resistant antibiotic until targeted therapy based on culture and sensitivity can be instituted. </p>
