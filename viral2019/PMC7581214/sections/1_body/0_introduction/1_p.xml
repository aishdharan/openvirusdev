The term encompasses the submandibular, parotid, masticator, peritonsillar, parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, pretracheal and prevertebral spaces. Infections originating in the ear, nose and/ or throat may spread to these spaces via contiguous or lymphatic spread resulting in abscess formation and subsequent life-threatening complications if left untreated [
