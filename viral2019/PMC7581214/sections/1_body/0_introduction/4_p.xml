<p>Paediatric deep neck space infections are a distinct entity from adult deep neck space infections as lymph nodes are more predominant in different anatomical sites in children, resulting in different clinical presentations.Â Children are an especially vulnerable group as their ability to communicate symptoms is limited and this results in diagnostic challenges from a clinical perspective, which poses a risk for serious complications [

 <xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The likely explanation for the difference is that adult deep neck space infections are usually due to dental pathology whilst pediatric deep neck space infections originate from various sources including tonsillitis, pharyngitis, hematogenous spread and suppurative cervical lymphadenitis [
