<p>We have previously documented the organisms and resistance patterns of paediatric DNSI in our setting [
 <xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the face of recognized high levels of antibiotic resistance amongst HIV-infected children and resultant implications for the choice of empiric therapy we studied the demography and documented the organisms and resistance patterns in HIV-infected children with DNSI [
 <xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first case series of DNSI in HIV-infected children.
