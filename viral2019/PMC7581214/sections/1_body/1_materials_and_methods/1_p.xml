<p>We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of paediatric patients (&lt;16years) diagnosed with deep neck infections at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic hospital for the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University of the Witwatersrand, between January 2010 and December 2018. A list was compiled of all children admitted with DNSI involving the submandibular, parotid, masticator, peritonsillar, parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, pretracheal and prevertebral spaces. Our policy is to perform surgical drainage in patients found to have a collection of pus on clinical or imaging examination; those with complications and those who did not respond to antibiotics within the first 48 hours.</p>
