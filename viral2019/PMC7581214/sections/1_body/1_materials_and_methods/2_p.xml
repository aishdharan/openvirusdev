<p>A total of 17 children with deep neck space infection were tested for associated HIV infection as a predisposing factor. This is because most pediatric patients presenting to our institution already have a ‘Road to Health Card’, on which their maternal HIV exposure is documented. National policy for prevention of mother-to-child transmission necessitates all HIV-exposed babies to be tested and their status is documented on this ‘Road to Health Card’. Therefore, only in cases of uncertainty, where there is likely maternal HIV exposure with concern of mother to child transmission, is an HIV test repeated. </p>
