<p>Our findings on microbiology, resistance and tuberculosis culture are significant even in the face of a small series and have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of DNSI in HIV-infected children. Tuberculosis testing should routinely be considered in high burden settings. We recommend the empiric use of a β‐lactamase-resistant antibiotic until targeted therapy based on culture and sensitivity can be instituted. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic management may lead to decreased in-hospital stays.</p>
