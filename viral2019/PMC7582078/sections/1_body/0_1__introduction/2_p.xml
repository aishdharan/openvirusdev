<p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, hydroxychloroquine has gained popularity as a potential preventative approach and therapeutic option for COVID-19 pneumonia. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The antiviral activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine stems from their ability to inhibit fusion of the virus with cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Other proposed mechanisms of protection include inhibition of nucleic acid replication and glycosylation of viral proteins [
