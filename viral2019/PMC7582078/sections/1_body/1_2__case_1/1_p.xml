The patient had been maintained on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily and methylprednisolone 8 mg daily for treatment of SLE for years prior to becoming ill with COVID-19. The patient had an uncomplicated hospital course. She was continued on her outpatient regimen of hydroxychloroquine, and her methylprednisolone dose was increased to 16 mg daily on admission. Additionally, she was treated with vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and atorvastatin on presentation. Her symptoms and inflammatory markers rapidly improved. She did not require any supplemental oxygen. The patient was discharged after fifteen days in stable condition.
