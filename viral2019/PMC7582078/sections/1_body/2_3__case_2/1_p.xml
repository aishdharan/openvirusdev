<p>A 42-year-old female with systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, epilepsy, hypertension, bipolar disorder, and SLE presented with a temperature of 102.2 F, shortness of breath, and cough. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab on admission. She was chronically maintained on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily and prednisone 15 mg daily for SLE prior to this acute illness. While hospitalized, the patient had increasing oxygen requirements up to 15 L via nasal cannula and elevated inflammatory and coagulation markers (

She was continued on her home hydroxychloroquine on admission, and her steroids were converted to intravenous methylprednisolone 80 mg daily on the fourth day of hospitalization. She was also treated with atorvastatin, vitamin C, and zinc on presentation. With these measures, she was eventually tapered off of supplemental oxygen and discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation unit on a prednisone taper after sixteen days of care.
