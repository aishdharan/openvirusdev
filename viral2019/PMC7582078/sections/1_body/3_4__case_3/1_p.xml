<p>A 62-year-old female with SLE, sarcoidosis, fibromyalgia, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and type 2 diabetes presented with a temperature of 102.8 F, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and diarrhea. She was in contact with a family member who had COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab on admission. She had been chronically maintained on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily and methylprednisolone 12 mg daily for treatment of SLE and sarcoidosis prior to her current illness. The patient was continued on her outpatient dose of hydroxychloroquine, and her corticosteroid was converted to intravenous methylprednisolone 100 mg every 12 hours on the second day of hospitalization. She was also treated with vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and atorvastatin on admission. The patient clinically deteriorated despite these interventions. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for escalating oxygen requirements and developed increasing inflammatory and coagulation markers (

Additionally, the patient completed a five-day course of remdesivir starting on the tenth day of hospitalization. Unfortunately, she expired from respiratory failure nineteen days after admission.
