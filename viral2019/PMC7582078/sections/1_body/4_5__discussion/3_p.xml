<p>Chloroquine, a close relative of hydroxychloroquine, has shown potent in vitro activity against influenza virus and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. SARS-CoV-1 was the cause of the SARS epidemic in 2003 [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In vivo studies using chloroquine in various animal models have failed to consistently translate into successful outcomes in treating these viral infections [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In a randomized trial, chloroquine was ineffective at preventing influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A comparison of chloroquine to hydroxychloroquine in vitro demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine was more effective against SAR-COV-2 [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This argues that hydroxychloroquine is a more potent agent than chloroquine for treating SARS-COV-2.
