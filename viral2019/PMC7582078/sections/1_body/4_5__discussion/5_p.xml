<p>The presented cases are similar to the abovementioned case series and add further doubt to any potent efficacy for hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, the presented cases further demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine use does not decrease the severity of illness. The included patients had varying severities of illness including critical illness requiring ventilator support. Chronic glucocorticoid treatment in these patients may have increased the risk of breakthrough infection in the setting of hydroxychloroquine, which may confound interpretation of these findings. Additionally, pre-existing conditions may have contributed to the severity of illness in these patients.</p>
