<p>High mutation and recombination rates of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) along with the rapid growth of its genetic diversity impede the development of an effective preventive HIV vaccine. The same properties of the virus however form the basis for studying the dynamics of evolutionary changes over time and track the patterns of virus spread during HIV-1 epidemics [
