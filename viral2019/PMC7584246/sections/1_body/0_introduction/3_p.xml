<p>The HIV/AIDS epidemic in FSU is driven by multiple HIV-1 M group subtypes and is far from being static. Before 1994, the number of HIV infections in FSU countries remained low, limited with nosocomial outbreaks caused by HIV-1 subtype G viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], homosexual men infected with subtype B viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and heterosexual individuals (HSX) infected with multiple African clades [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Subsequently, HIV-1 infections began to increase dramatically due to the spread of the sub-subtype A6 strains among injective drug users (IDUs) in Odessa (Ukraine) [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Originating from a Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ancestor, this sub-subtype seemed to spread in Ukraine for about ten years via sexual intercourse at relatively low transmission rate before spreading explosively among IDUs (1994) [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. After early dispersal in Ukraine, the sub-subtype A6 rapidly spread to all FSU countries along the drug trafficking routes and caused epidemics in at least twelve out of fifteen FSU countries from the Baltic to Central Asia, including Russia [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Estonia is probably the only country in FSU where non-A6 subtype (CRF06_cpx) established an epidemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Soon after that, the co-circulation of subtype A6 and non-African CRF02_AG lineage, which was first detected in Tashkent (Uzbekistan) [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] led to the generation of CRF063_02A1 which subsequently rapidly spread in Central Asian countries and thereafter moved to Russia (in 2003 and 2007) mainly by the sexual route [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. At the same time, subtype A6 generated the circulating recombinant form CRF03_AB through the recombination with subtype B clade (designated B-FSU or IDU-B) [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which led to the outbreak of HIV-infection in Kaliningrad region [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In subsequent years, similar outbreaks were also reported in other regions of Russia [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Belarus [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Lithuania [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. After expansion in northwestern FSU regions, the CRF03_AB was introduced to the Central Asian and Caucasian countries, where it was rarely detected during the last decade.
