<p>This study was performed using the HIV-1 CRF03_AB recombinant sequences obtained from two sources. All the publicly available HIV-1 sequences from individual patients with known sampling date and location studied in the FSU countries were retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (data available as of January 20, 2019;

Sequences selecting was carried out manually in order to maximize the length and the number of segments for analysis. Sequences with incorrect classification were removed, resulting in a total dataset of 434 partial or complete HIV-1 CRF03_AB sequences from Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. In four FSU countries (Armenia, Georgia, Moldova and Turkmenistan) CRF03_AB viruses were not found. Additional non-deposited sequences were collected from the Russian local AIDS centers.
