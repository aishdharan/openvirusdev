<p>The estimates of ancestral geographic movements throughout the phylogenetic history were obtained using the discrete phylogeographic approach and Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) procedure with a CTMC rate reference prior was carried in BEAST v1.8.2. Two runs were run of 500×10
 <sup>6</sup> steps for MCMC chains with parameters sampled every 5000 generations, with a burn-in of first 35%. The ESS value for each parameter was over 200. The MCC trees were summarized using TreeAnnotator v1.8.2 and visualized in FigTree v1.4.0. The migration routes and spatial projections were summarized using the SPREAD software [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The statistical support for migration routes was determined with Bayes Factor (BF); a route with the BF-support ≥ 3 was considered credible.
