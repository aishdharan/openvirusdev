<p>To estimate the prevalence of CRF03_AB recombinant in FSU, we found 32 independent studies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241269.s006">S1 Table</xref>) that contained the relevant data on 6285 successfully genotyped samples from 6 different FSU countries (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia). Of these, CRF03_AB strains were detected in 170 cases, including 146 cases among Russian samples. The sample size of these studies varied from 7 to 1055 with a median of 141.9 patients.
