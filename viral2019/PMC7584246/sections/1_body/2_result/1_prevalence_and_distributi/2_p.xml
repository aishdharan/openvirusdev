<p>Our meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of CRF03_AB in Russia was 5,9% (95% CI: 4.1–7.8) and vary among the different regions (

The overall proportions were as follows: 0.2% (95% CI: 0,0–0,5) for Central Federal District, 0.8% (95% CI: 0.1–1.6) for Far Eastern Federal District, 1.3% (95% CI: 0,1–2,7) for Volga Federal District, 4.6% (95% CI: 0.0–9.7) for Ural Federal District, and 17.2% (95% CI: 7.9–26.5) for Northwestern Federal District. Although no case of CRF03_AB infection was found in the Siberian federal district, this recombinant may nonetheless be present here within the confidence interval indicator of 0.3%(95% CI: 0.0–0.6). The heterogeneity was not found to be statistically significant in all Federal Districts (
