<p>The pooled prevalence of CRF03_AB among different FSU countries has also varied. We estimated that CRF03_AB has a lower prevalence in Latvia (0.3%), Estonia (0.4%) and Ukraine (0.4%) than in Belarus (2.9%), with the highest prevalence in Lithuania (11.6%). In total, the pooled prevalence of CRF03_AB in these FSU countries, together with the Northwestern Federal District of Russia, was 9.9% being characterized with high heterogeneity (
