<p>Here, we used the dataset consisting of 151 HIV-1 CRF03_AB recombinant 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences in total collected in FSU (
 <italic>N</italic> = 145) and other countries (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6) during 22 years (
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); nine out of fifteen FSU countries were covered. Among FSU sequences, 57.9% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 84) were retrieved from HIV LANL and the other 42.1% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 61) were obtained from local AIDS centers. The majority sequences were obtained in Russia (84.1%) and Lithuania (4.8%) and the remaining countries were represented by â‰¤5 sequences each.
