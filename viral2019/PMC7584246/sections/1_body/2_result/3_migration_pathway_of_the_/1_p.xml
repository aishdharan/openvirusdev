<p>Phylogeographic analysis was performed using only countries/locations with at least 3 available sequences, resulting in a dataset of 137 sequences from six countries (Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Spain); Russian sequences were represented by seven separate regions/cities (
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The estimation of genetic flow between different locations supported at least 14 HIV-1 CRF03_AB recombinant migrations events, eleven of which involved the city of Kaliningrad (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241269.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In addition, the root of the phylogeographic tree, as mentioned above, was located in this city. The most strongly supported viral migration route was found between Kaliningrad and Ekaterinburg (logBF = 4.9), Kaliningrad and Cherepovets (logBF = 3.9), and Kaliningrad and Saint-Petersburg (logBF = 3.7). Five other routes connecting Kaliningradto Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Belarus, Lithuania, and Spain were slightly less supported (2.0&gt;logBF&gt;1.0). Finally, the reliable genetic flow (logBF≥0.5) was also found between Kaliningrad and Perm’, Ekaterinburg, Tumen’, Krasnodar, and Yamal. Three remaining routes connected Saint-Petersburg to Kazakhstan, Ekaterinburg to Tumen, and Ekaterinburg to Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous district (
