<p>All 145 available CRF03_AB sequences from FSU were used to reconstruct the demographic history of this HIV-1 recombinant in the region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241269.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The reconstruction of population dynamics with the Bayesian Skyline model suggested that the CRF03_AB recombinant in FSU experienced an initial rapid growth until the beginning of the 2004, it reached a stabilization of the effective population size in 2006, and then declined after 2015. It is notable that the Bayesian (GMRF) Skyrid model, supported a longer growth phase until late 2010, followed by a population size decline that extended till present time; though this model may uncover some aspects of the population history undetected by other Bayesian models [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], we rely on the BSP data here.
