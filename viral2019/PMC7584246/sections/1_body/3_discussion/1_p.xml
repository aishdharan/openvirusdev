<p>The prevalence of different HIV-1 subtypes have experienced a tremendous change in the FSU region and the present epidemic here is predominantly driven by heterosexual practice [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In recent decade, the epidemic evolved with an increase both in the incidence and prevalence of HIV-1 non-A6 subtypes, primarily recombinant forms [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Hence, recombinant forms spread are becoming a serious public health challenge, which requires a deeper understanding of their origin and distribution. Among the recombinant forms in FSU, HIV-1 CRF03_AB recombinant is one of the common recombinants and even the second most prevalent HIV-1 subtype [
 <xref rid="pone.0241269.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in some countries (Lithuania). We report here the results of the first systematic review of the CRF03_AB infection prevalence based on 32 eligible studies and also present its spatiotemporal dynamics in the FSU using publicly available sequences and Bayesian phylogenetic approach.
