<p>The result of our study showed that the countries to which the recombinant virus first entered and established an epidemic–Lithuania (11.6%), Russia (5.9%) and Belarus (2.9%) were the most affected by CRF03_AB infection, while in neighboring Baltic FSU countries–Estonia (0.4%) and Latvia (0.3%), as well as Ukraine (0.3%), this recombinant displayed a much more restricted local dissemination. This indicates that the extraordinary epidemic consequence of HIV-1 CRF03_AB recombinant is probably associated not only introduction into highly connected transmission networks, but also with an earlier entry into this group. Although the prevalence of CRF03_AB infection is in a stable (low) trend, this recombinant is the third most prevalent HIV-1 CRF in northwestern FSU countries. Unfortunately, the scarcity of data regarding the risk factors for HIV infection in the dataset did not enable comparison of estimated prevalence between different populations. In Russia, the Northwestern federal district (17.2%), Ural federal district (4.6), and Volga federal district (1.3%) had a high-level epidemic of HIV-1 CRF03_AB recombinant. Taken together, these results seem to indicate that CRF03_AB has largely contributed to the HIV epidemic in the region and may affect the epidemic in the future.</p>
