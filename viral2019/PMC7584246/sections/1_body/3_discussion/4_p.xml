<p>Nevertheless, given the high heterogeneity between studies, the pooled prevalence estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution. In particular, the heterogeneity in pooled prevalence estimates may be due to the bias introduced by study methods, geographical location of the study, sample size, and year of data collection, or data collection method. It is not excluded that this latter factor is a major source of heterogeneity in CRF03_AB prevalence studies in FSU as the majority of included studies apparently were based on "convenience sampling".</p>
