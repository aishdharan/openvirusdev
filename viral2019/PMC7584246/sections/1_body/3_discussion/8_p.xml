<p>Some comments should be made concerning the limitations of this study. First, some studies identified subtypes by a single HIV-1 genome region, which may lead to subtyping errors, thus affecting the estimated CRF03_AB prevalence. Second, the small sample size in some countries might not be a representative for the real HIV population. These circumstances combined with the large sequence number variability in each country may in particular, be a bias to the assessment of proposed migration routes and prevent the detection of all viral migration movements in the FSU. Another limitation of our review may be the inclusion of only published studies, which may be a potential source of publication bias. Thus, caution is advised regarding the interpretation of the findings from present study.</p>
