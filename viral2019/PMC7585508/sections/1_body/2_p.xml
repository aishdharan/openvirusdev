A total of 94,770 pregnant women had received health care services in Chengdu by the end of 29 February 2020. As of 10 March 2020, Chengdu managed 406 pregnant women who came from Hubei Province or from abroad, such as South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and who had been in close contact with people from these high-risk areas. So far no suspected cases were detected among pregnant women in Chengdu. In the global pandemic scenario, however, effective implementation of management measures is very important to prevent pregnant women from being infected by the SARS-CoV-2. Sichuan Province enforced the level-1 public health emergency response between 24 January and 26 February 2020.

There had been no confirmed cases of maternal infection in Chengdu until 24 July 2020, demonstrating that the control and prevention measures were effective.
