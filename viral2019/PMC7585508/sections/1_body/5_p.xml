<p>Secondly, all patients in our hospital were divided into three levels for pre-examination, which are monitoring of body temperature at “pre-examination inquiries” points of out-patient department (level one), “outpatient inquiries” at nurses’ station (level two), and physicians ask the patients about their body temperature (level three).
 <underline>_</underline> A medical treatment group was established especially for pregnant women and children infected with COVID-19. All patients, once confirmed to be COVID-19 positive, will be treated following the latest version of the Chinese national “Novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan”. The viral loads detected in the nose were found to be higher than in the throat,

However, as a large group of patients in our hospital are children, throat swabs were used in most cases due to children’s low level of cooperation. Three levels of response were setup in our hospital, and four isolation observation beds are reserved in the emergency department (level-three response). If there are more than five suspected cases, level-two response will be activated, and if there are more than 15 suspected cases, level-one response will be activated. The human and material resources are prepared and will be allocated accordingly. Specifically, at level-two response, twelve isolation observation beds will be reserved, and nine obstetricians, two neonatologists, six operating room nurses, and six midwives will be allocated to manage the suspected cases. At level-one response, the corresponding number of reserved isolation observation beds, obstetricians, neonatologists, operating room nurses and midwives will be 50, 45, 10, 18, and 18, respectively.
