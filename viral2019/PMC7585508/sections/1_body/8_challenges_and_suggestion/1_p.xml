<p>Chengdu made significant efforts and got some achievements in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic among pregnant women. Despite the fact that there is no report of COVID-19 infection among pregnant women in Chengdu, World Health Organization has announced the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Every day, many people residing in other countries are coming to Chengdu and pregnant women may have close contact with these people. Facing rising pressure of guarding against imported cases and preventing a resurgence of the outbreak at home, strict prevention and control measures should not be neglected. As the cases of COVID-19 have reached alarming levels in many countries, it is necessary to make prevention and control interventions a regular and long-term process. What we have learned from the COVID-19 epidemic and pandemic may help to improve the effectiveness of future clinical practices in terms of diagnosis and treatment of new infectious diseases. However, more consideration should be given to the allocation of medical human resources, particularly in scenarios where doctors and nurses are infected with COVID-19.</p>
