 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, PLWH have higher rates of certain underlying health conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Those conditions can increase their risk for more severe illness if people with HIV get COVID-19, especially people with advanced HIV disease. The pressure over the increased severity of COVID-19 among PLWH are based on their vulnerability to a predisposition to numerous opportunistic infections [
