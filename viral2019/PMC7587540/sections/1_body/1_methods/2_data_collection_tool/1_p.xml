<p id="Par7">The data collection tool was adapted from two previous COVID-19 KAP studies and WHO recommendations. The questionnaire was initially developed in English, then translated into Kinyarwanda by GP (a public health scientist) and then translated back into English by PGI (a public health scientist) to ensure translation accuracy. The questionnaire was validated in a pilot of 15 participants before the actual survey data collection. Minor changes were made to the questionnaire at this stage. The questionnaire addressed collected information on participantâ€™s demographics (including age, gender, employment status, place of residence), assessed knowledge (15 questions), attitude (10 questions), and practice (10 questions). More details on the specific questions are available on the questionnaire (Supplementary File 1).</p>
