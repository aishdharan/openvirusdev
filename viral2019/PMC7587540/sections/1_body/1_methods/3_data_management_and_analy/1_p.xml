<p id="Par8">Data was captured electronically on an excel sheet. Frequency and percentage were used to analyze categorical variables, while the mean and standard deviation summarize continuous data. Quality scores were calculated as a measure of the participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and practice levels. The quality score is calculated by summing up all the individual items' scores in the three sections and scaling the total as a percentage of the maximum possible score. The scaled quality score = (obtained score – minimum possible score)/(maximum possible score – minimum possible score) × 100%. The student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between low (&lt;65%) and high (≥65%) KAP scores. The Chi-square test was used to determine the association between KAP scores and categorical variables. All tests were statistically measured at 5% level of significance using STATA statistical package version 11.2 (STATA Corp., Texas, USA).</p>
