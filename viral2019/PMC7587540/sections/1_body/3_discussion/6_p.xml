<p id="Par19">In conclusion, the current study was able to give a comprehensive assessment of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of PLWHI in Kigali towards COVID-19. The outcomes suggest that PLWH in Kigali have a satisfactory level of knowledge on COVID-19 and are mostly positive in their practice and attitude on overcoming the pandemic, although females are more cautious than males. Regardless, regular messaging from the MOH and other authorities are important to increase public knowledge, practices, and attitude towards COVID-19. The results found no association between knowledge score and gender, age, residence, employment, and duration on ART. Moreover, some groups of PLWH may benefit from targeted health education interventions to raise COVID-19 awareness and improve practices. Improving the KAP of vulnerable populations is essential during pandemic outbreaks like COVID-19. Consequently, the development of effective health education systems incorporating considerations of KAP-modifying factors is needed.</p>
