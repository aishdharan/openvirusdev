 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), multiple electronic sources: Medline/PubMed, SciFinder, Science Direct and Goggle Scholar as well as ResearchGate and General (Google) were investigated via queries with a non-restricted time frame reaching the 20
 <sup>th</sup> of August 2020. Initial investigation of SSEs and SARS, SSEs and MERS, and SSEs and COVID-19, gave narrative results from PubMed. The selected literature, which is included in the study, is presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Same items were also searched in all other mentioned sources. The scope of the study was not only to investigate the transmission of SARS-COV-2 due to SSEs, its comparison with SARS-COV-1 and MERS-COV, but also to assess the general global impact due to SSEs by COVID-19. Therefore, further literature investigation was performed using the same electronic sources. Further investigation was made on: a) the prevention of SSEs by coronaviruses causing SAR-1, MERS and COVID-19, b) the socio-economic relation of SARS-COV-1, MERS and COVID-19 due to SSEs, c) the austerity caused by SSEs of COVID-19, and d) the relation of SSEs containment to future vaccination programs. For further investigation, the following items were searched: “SARS, MERS and COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention”, “SARS MERS and COVID-19 Infectivity and Pathogenicity”, “Coronavirus SSE Prevention”, SSE Coronavirus Crisis and Socio-economics”, “Holy Cup Religion and Transmission of Pathogens and SSEs”, and “Coronavirus Immunity and Vaccination”.
