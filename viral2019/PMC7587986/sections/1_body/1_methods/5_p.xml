<p>Studies providing an adequate determination of an SSE related to SARS, MERS and COVID-19 were primarily screened and selected by two reviewers (authors) blinded to one another. The results were thereafter cross-matched and duplicates were removed. Based on this primary search, the socio-economic impact of coronavirus, produced by SSEs, was extrapolated by two other reviewers (authors). Following this initial selection stage, further screening was performed by all reviewers, using the previously described search items to identify parameters determining the global impact of COVID-19 due to SSEs. Identified parameters included the global impact of immunity and vaccination, the holy cup and religion transmission, and the austerity caused by COVID-19 and other coronavirus epidemics due to restrictions applied. All search results were cross-matched to remove duplicates and thereafter, exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied. </p>
