<p>After removing the duplicates, review was conducted on titles and abstracts. Also, a decision was made to remove “news press opinions”. Computational model methodologies producing contradictory results, studies with wrong interpretation of SSEs, and studies with non-clear-cut results were also removed. Studies using the interpretation “a super spreading individual, known as the index case, produces a cluster of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 secondary infections” were included. A second exclusion criterion was applied. In this stage, peer reviewed literature of recent dates, studies assessing SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 epidemiology measures, studies on COVID-19 restriction measures producing social and economic austerity, articles discussing the perspective for future vaccination and population immunity, and finally genetic studies on coronaviruses causing SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. </p>
