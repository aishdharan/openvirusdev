<p>In the case of Diamond Princess Cruise ship, an early-assessed R
 <sub>0</sub> of 14.8 (≈4 times higher than the R
 <sub>0</sub> in the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, China) was decreased to an assessed effective R
 <sub>o</sub> of 1.78 following on-board isolation and quarantine processes (

Similarly, in China (Wuhan) the application of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the society, including a cordon sanitaire of the town; interruption of community transport, school, and most employment; and termination of all community events decreased the R
 <sub>o</sub> from 3.86 to 0.32 over a 5-week period (
