<p>Emerging research evidence (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) regarding sewage contamination that preceded Paris COVID-19 epidemic is pointing to the reports of 2003 from the health department of Hong Kong (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), the noble work by Ng (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and urge for extensive environmental monitoring (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) to prevent future COVID-19 relapses. However, the flow of genetic variation may be even more complex as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Therefore, advanced clinical and laboratory monitoring is required to prevent SSEs and thereafter, new coronavirus epidemics. Assembly of key functions and screening techniques of reference centers is presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Newer therapeutic agents and protocol applications are promising (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), although probably carrying the possibility of resistance state (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). First, these also require specific diagnostic and surveillance strategies to overcome any unknown adverse epidemiology consequences (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Inhibiting wild meat markets and related consumption of wild meat by creating vivid campaigns could be a critical for interrupting the introduction of coronaviruses crossing from animals to the human population, as was the case for SARS (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) epidemics, and probably now for COVID-19 pandemic (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Furthermore, the food production process requires radical reconsideration, concerning the industrial environment of current food production and serious violations of natural ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Current industrial procedures for preparing food increasingly favor conditions where viral evolution produces new mutations and increased rates of mutations (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), thus raising the probability of new and more infectious viral strains. In SARS and MERS epidemics, the role of SSEs in vigorously distributing the epidemics has been substantially proven (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>-
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The new COVID-19 epidemiology evidence also adequately highlights the important role of SSEs in homeland of China (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), although surprising evidence from neighboring countries show the unlikely role of SSE in the spread of the disease (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).
