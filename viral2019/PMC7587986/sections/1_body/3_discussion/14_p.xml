<p>The 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family is characterized by a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. Mouse hepatitis virus is a representative member of the family (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Additionally, human hepatitis E virus also has a positive-sense single stranded RNA genome and shares a common evolution pathway with coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Hepatitis-related incidents were described for SARS (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The genetic recombination of these viruses within arbitrary intermediate hosts produced contagious strains that are extremely pathogenic to humans (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). In this respect, the relation of SARS-COV genetic sequences isolated from human, civets, and bats permitted us to find the reason for such a dangerous epidemic, which affected people on a worldwide scale in 2003 (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Moreover, the unpredictable epidemic of MERS-COV posed a serious risk to the health of communities worldwide. These underscored the necessity for further research of the virus epidemiology and pathophysiology to develop successful therapeutic and preventive medications against MERS-COV infection (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). While SARS-COV-2 is genetically and structurally connected with MERS-COV, it has its own exclusive structures which are responsible for its quick spread throughout the world (
