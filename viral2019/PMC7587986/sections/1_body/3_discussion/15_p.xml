<p>Specifically, variations in coronavirus pathogenicity within different species (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) make the understanding of SARS epidemics even more unclear through their capability to overcome the barrier for cross species transmission, which also alters their infectivity status (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). As a result, boosting the pathogenic behavior of 
 <italic>coronavirus </italic>strains, within species (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), and across species barriers (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), which is a reflection of their positive adaptation to rapid recombination events (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The recent MERS epidemic revealed the tendency of the strain to genetically adapt and produce greater outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) as occurred in SARS epidemic in 2003 (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). However, mainly for socioeconomic reasons, alarm signals were ignored until recently (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). A new phylogenetic analysis technique employed on clustered COVID-19 strains displayed a geographic variation preference in infectivity and pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This is probably due to predominating strainâ€™s tendency to cause an SSE as an outcome of a multi- factorial epidemic process presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Marked SSEs for COVID-19 have already been fully characterized and warrant urgent investigation (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, each way of transmission should be investigated. Heterogeneity of epidemic characteristics across nations (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) implies that in this way we may minimize coronavirus transmission. Therefore, salvation of national economic catastrophes will also be achieved in this way (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Thus, the whole Biomedical Science machinery needs to perform targeted diagnosis of SSEs and share the obtained experience. Subsequently, central authorities will no longer need excessive non-specific contact measures, which will in turn normalize both societal and economic activities.
