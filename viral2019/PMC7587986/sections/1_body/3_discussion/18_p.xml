<p>The detection of HBV DNA in saliva motivated our study group to investigate the potential viral transmission through the Holy Communion Cup. Two successive retrospective studies were conducted to investigate the role of Holy Communion as an independent risk factor of HBV dispersion. The first preliminary study included patients from our registry of those with chronic hepatitis B under entecavir (Jannis Kountouras-personal communication) treatment (

Other parameters studied, the substantial independent categorical variable to evaluate our hypothesis was the patients’ occupation, thereby introducing two sub-groups; priests and non-priests. This classification was performed based on a standard active and perpetual exhibition (at least once weekly) of priests to many people’s saliva, as a part of the grounded process of the Holy Communion Cup. The control group comprised of the aggregate of Orthodox priests in Greece (10,338) and the rest general population (10,680,866) at that timeframe. Approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee was obtained and all predispositions of the Helsinki Declaration were fulfilled. The reservoir database did not include any personified information (name, ID number, etc.) and thus no informed consent was required. Pearson's chi-squared test with 1 degree of freedom was performed to evaluate whether there was a statistically significant difference between the frequencies of HBV infection in case and control groups and statistical significance was set at
