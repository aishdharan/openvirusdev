<p>The first single-centre registry included 71 patients and one (1.4%) of them was a priest. Chronic hepatitis B was significantly more frequent among non-priests compared to priests (x
 <sup>2</sup> (1, N=71)=12.65, 
 <italic>p &lt;0.05</italic>). The extended sample (N=429) included the registry of another Department and an aggregate of four (0.93%) priests were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B. Likewise, the chi-square test revealed that non-priest subjects were more likely to suffer from chronic hepatitis from HBV infection compared to priests (x
 <sup>2</sup> (1, N=429) = 31, 
 <italic>p &lt;0.001</italic>). In conclusion, both of our analyses indicated a lower prevalence of HBV chronic hepatitis among priests when compared to other occupations.
