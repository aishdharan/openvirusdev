<p>Currently, vaccines for COVID-19 are in pre-clinical development, and no final clinical phase has been ended due the recent emergence of the disorder. Many global entities have stated their plans to produce a vaccine for COVID-19. According to the WHO, 41 candidate vaccines are being produced for COVID-19 as of March 13, 2020 (

Importantly, for production of highly effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines, features such as the possibility of the induction of antigen-dependent enhancement (ADE) and additional severe opposing effects previously detected with SARS and MERS should be considered. ADE is a phenomenon that occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies against proteins of a virus increase, also increasing virus infectivity (

This can be the consequence of an ADE phenomenon. This underlines a mechanism by which specific antibodies facilitate infection with the targeted virus, or cell-based augmentation, a process resulting in an allergic inflammatory response induced by immunopathology (
