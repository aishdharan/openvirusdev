Epidemiological research has proposed that the outbreak was related to a seafood market in Wuhan (Hubei, China), underlining the ongoing risk of viral transmission from animals to induce severe diseases in humans. Metagenomic RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient with pneumonia identified a novel RNA virus strain from the Coronaviridae family  (called SARS-COV-2); and phylogenetic analysis (by introducing the widely used

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) disclosed that the virus was most closely connected (89.1% nucleotide similarity) with a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus
