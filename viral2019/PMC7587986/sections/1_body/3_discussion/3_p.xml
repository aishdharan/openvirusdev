<p>Insights from previous reports by Menachery et al. (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) (Menachery 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015), pointed out that the 2002-2003 emergence of SARS-CoV introduced the possibility of viruses of animal origin causing epidemics in human populations. Conclusions from their study revealed, as previous studies had demonstrated (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), that closely related SARS-like viral genes were traceable in Chinese bat populations. Authors claimed that these viruses were capable of infecting humans, by selective adaptations or adjustments, and thereby, causing a new epidemic (
