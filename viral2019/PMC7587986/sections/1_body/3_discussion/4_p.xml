<p>Continuous viral random mutations are possible through intermediate host transmission, until a deadly virus develops, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Recent evidence revealed that recombination within intermediate hosts has contributed to development of SARS-COV-2 (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Asian outdoor markets could constitute the ideal places for continuous viral mutation exchanges (

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the best way to circumvent continuous virus production is targeted surveillance; to at least stop the overspreading by SSEs (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This has also been proposed by Menachery et al. (
