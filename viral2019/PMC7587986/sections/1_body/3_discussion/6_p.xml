<p>SARS-COV-2 is accountable for the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and the interplaying mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 include SARS-COV-2 virulence, host immune response, and complex inflammatory reactions (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Emerging data, also, imply that the reservoirs of SARS-COV-1 infection may be similar to COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), as remarkable similarities exist between SARS and swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS)Â in topographical, temporal, environmental and etiological backgrounds. However, the increasing coronavirus variety and spread in bats were recognized as a potential target to diminish future epidemics that might impend livestock, community health, and financial progress (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Probably, identification of animal and insect vectors that transmit the disease, identification and control of alternative routes of transmission like fecal-oral route, and identification of super spreader patient groups could help minimize the epidemiological extent compared to the one observed for SARS-COV-2 infection worldwide. Lessons from SARS epidemic taught us that the key to control is minimizing the time from the diagnosis of infection to prompt hospital isolation and diminishing the probability of another SSE (
