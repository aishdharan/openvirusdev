<p>This study aimed to perform a literature review. Although effort was made to decrease the risk of bias of results via double-blind screening of literature and employment of multiple electronic search engines, bias cannot be eliminated due to incomplete retrieval of identified research and biased estimations of included literature conclusions and methods used. Outcome of the study may also contain biased estimations originating from wrong interpretation of super spreading individuals in literature reviewed for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 outbreaks. Although the importance of SSEs in COVID-19 was recognized by this study, more data from future accumulated epidemiology studies are needed to justify these findings. </p>
