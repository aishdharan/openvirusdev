<p>Taken all together, management of SSEs is mandatory to yield efficient control over SARS-CoV-2. This is achievable through early diagnosis of pre/asymptomatic infected individuals within potential super spreading groups. Prevention of outbreaks is more essential, especially due to the lack of efficient vaccination and therapeutic protocols, which necessitates efficient monitoring, as SARS-COV-2 virus follows complex infectious patterns. The SARS-COV-2 epidemiological models that do not take SSEs into consideration seem to lead to confusing results with high uncertainty. SARS-CoV-2 causes prolonged “pandemics” through complex adaptation routes. Currently, in addition to the high technology utilized for diagnosis, clinical observation is indispensable to deeply comprehend SSEs and prohibit further outspread of COVID-19. Reference laboratories with efficient and accredited molecular and serological diagnosis must be inter-linked between countries. All these parameters could contribute to avoiding a second blind unjustified response that characterized the first COVID-19 pandemic spread. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 through SSEs could be preventive for future epidemics. A systematic meta-analysis research methodology, when COVID-19 epidemiology data accumulate further, would be advisable to confirm the conclusions of this study.</p>
