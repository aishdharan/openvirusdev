 <caption> Flow of genetic variation of coronaviruses leading to increase of virulence and pathogenicity; epidemiologic steps for specific and targeted diagnosis to prevent super spread events. Blue arrows point to the flow of genetic variation across gene pools where genetic variation occurs, i.e. a) between hosts of the same species, b) between hosts of different species by crossing the species barrier, spreading to c) humans and subsequently to super spreader individuals, where disease transmission is potentiated. Grey arrows point to specific identifications that can lead to effective interventions with the potential to control the disease spread </caption>
