<p>For this study, we quantitatively assessed outbreak response in the African Region by measuring the timeliness and associated factors of reaching 3 milestones in outbreak response—detection, notification, and end—to determine if progress has been achieved since 2017 in the African Region. Our results provide a baseline metric for assessing progress towards improved disease surveillance and outbreak response in the region. </p>
