<p>We undertook a retrospective study of responses to all substantiated disease outbreaks reported to WHO by member states in the African Region during 2017â€“2019. Outbreaks were reported using the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy. A substantiated outbreak was defined as one whose hazard was confirmed or in which the occurrence of human cases was clearly in excess of normal expectancy; that is, the epidemic threshold was reached or surpassed. The substantiated disease outbreaks constituted a subset of all the public health events reported to WHO, which also encompasses humanitarian and other health emergencies. </p>
