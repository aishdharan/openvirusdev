<p>We used secondary sources to complete missing data, including the WHO event management system, IDSR weekly bulletins produced by member states in the African Region, outbreak investigation and situation reports submitted to WHO via email, published articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and the World Development Indicators database. The event management system is an online central repository for all globally reported events that may constitute a public health risk to countries through the international spread of disease or that may require a coordinated international response as required by IHR 2005 regulations (

We chose these predictor variables guided by available theoretical and empirical literature to determine how well our results agree with those of other published studies concerning these predictors and also to identify what is unique to the African Region.
