<p>Humanitarian emergencies and other public health events reported to WHO that did not constitute a disease outbreak were initially excluded because we could not estimate key milestone dates and their end dates did not necessarily depend on timely implementation of public health response given the context in which they occurred. Only substantiated disease outbreaks were selected for the study. Before analyzing the outcomes of interest, for each variable we discarded data from any outbreaks missing key milestone dates, while retaining data from that outbreak in other analyses that did not involve variables with missing data (
