<p>We adapted the definition of milestones used by Chan et al. (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>15</italic>
 </xref>). We chose 4 key dates from each outbreak to determine milestones for the analysis: dates of onset, detection, notification, and end of outbreak. For date of onset we used the reported date of symptom onset for the first case found by the investigators. For date of detection we used the date on which national authorities were alerted to the outbreak. For date of notification we used the date the event was first reported to WHO by a member state. For date of end we used either the date when a country declared an outbreak to have ended, or a defined length of time over which no new cases were reported. As a proxy, we used twice the maximum incubation period from the date of recovery or death for the last case. We chose this definition to ensure that disease transmission was no longer occurring and the outbreak was over.
