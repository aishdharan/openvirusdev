<p>We performed univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses in 3 separate models to assess the rates of change over time to outbreak detection, notification, and end. Predictor variables were outbreak start year, WHO African subregion, income, number of refugees, percentage of internally displaced population, current health expenditure as percentage of gross domestic product, population density, and disease category. Each outbreak milestone was treated independently. </p>
