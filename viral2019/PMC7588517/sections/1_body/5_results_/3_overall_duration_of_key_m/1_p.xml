<p>We found an overall median time of 8 (IQR 2–28) days for time to detection, 3 (IQR 0–9) days for time to notification, and 77 (IQR 33–165) days for time to end. When analyzed by disease category, vaccine-preventable diseases had the longest median time to detection of 28 (IQR 8–50) days, whereas food/waterborne diseases had the shortest at 2 (IQR 0–7) days. The longest median time to end was 138 (IQR 48–232) days for vectorborne diseases and the shortest was 42 (IQR 17–146) days for diseases in the others category. Median times for these and the other stratifying variables—income, WHO African subregion, number of refugees, internally displaced population, current health expenditure, and population density—are shown in
