<p>The multivariable Cox proportional hazards models confirmed the improvement of the time to detection during 2017–2019, time to end from 2017 through 2018, and the increase in time to notification during 2017–2019 (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The other variable associated with time to detection and end was the disease category. HRs for time to detection decreased by 54% (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29–0.73) and time to end by 47% (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34–0.83) for vaccine-preventable diseases compared with food/waterborne diseases.
