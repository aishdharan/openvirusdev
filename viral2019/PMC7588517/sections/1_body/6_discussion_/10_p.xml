<p>In conclusion, our study has established that the use of simple, easy-to-collect, and verifiable metrics is key to monitoring the timeliness of outbreak detection and response in the WHO African Region. The findings of improvement in early outbreak detection and rapid control over the studied period should be interpreted within the context of the variations and multiple factors that influence these outcomes. Further studies could shed better light on these variations within the member states, and across subregions and disease categories. The momentum needs to be sustained and member states supported in building capacities for early detection, notification, and rapid control of outbreaks. It is equally necessary to support member states to enable them to track key milestones systematically for continuous measurement of outbreak response performance.</p>
