<p>Early detection and rapid response to outbreaks greatly contributed to reducing the illness and death rates during these events. Timeliness of response is an essential element of surveillance systems (

Systematically capturing and analyzing the timeliness of key milestones in outbreak detection and response can also provide critical information to public health decision makers and stakeholders on progress made towards implementing IHR requirements. Our analyses explored trends in the timeliness of detection, notification, and end of outbreaks over 3 years (2017â€“2019) in the WHO African Region and predictor variables that could explain changes. Overall, the findings showed a decrease in the median time to detection and end of outbreaks over the years, signaling an improvement in capacities in these areas. In contrast, the median time to notification increased.
