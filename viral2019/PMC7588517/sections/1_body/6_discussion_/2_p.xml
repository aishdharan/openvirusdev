<p>Our finding of overall improvement in time to detection of outbreaks in the African Region was consistent with 2 other studies, although the period studied, geography, and variables analyzed differed (

 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). In our study, the disease category was associated with differences in time to detection. Time to clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation of a disease affect time to detection. The median time to detection of food/waterborne disease outbreaks was found to be shorter than for other disease categories. Our final dataset contained a high number of food/waterborne diseases, with outbreaks of cholera the most frequent. Cholera has a relatively short incubation period compared with other diseases and the potential to spread rapidly, causing large-scale outbreaks (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>). The main approach to clinical diagnosis and surveillance of cholera has been the use of the case definitions (

 </xref>), coupled with the short incubation period, contribute to early detection of outbreaks of cholera. In addition, laboratory capacities for confirming
