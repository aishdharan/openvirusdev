<p>The lower hazard ratio for time to detection of vaccine-preventable diseases compared with food/waterborne diseases could be explained in the context of the outbreak threshold for these diseases and how they are monitored. The IDSR outbreak threshold for cholera is one confirmed case while most vaccine-preventable diseases require several cases over a period of time to reach the epidemic threshold (

 </xref>). Cholera outbreaks, therefore, are more likely to generate a quick alarm. Furthermore, monitoring of diseases reaching an outbreak threshold in the region continues to be performed mainly through indicator-based surveillance that relies on structured weekly IDSR reports from health facilities. This structure could likely result in delays in early detection of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks because this system captures only those cases from people visiting a health facility. Event-based surveillance systems are designed to address this limitation by capturing reports from a wide variety of sources. For example, introducing community event-based surveillance contributed to increased reporting of suspected cases of measles in Liberia, leading to early detection of measles outbreaks (
