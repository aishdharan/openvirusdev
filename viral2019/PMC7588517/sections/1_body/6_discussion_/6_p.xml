<p>Many countries in the WHO African Region continue to experience recurrent disease outbreaks. Lessons gained from each outbreak response have helped to improve response to subsequent outbreaks, a possible reason for the reduction in time to end. The lower HR for controlling outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases compared with food/waterborne disease outbreaks may reflect challenges associated with vaccine acquisition, uptake, and access, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. </p>
