<p>There are 3 main limitations of the study. First, key milestone dates were missing in some of the reports sent to WHO, which excluded some outbreaks from the analysis. This omission may have had some effect on the findings, although efforts were made to ensure that the sample was representative of the study population of events (

Only those reported to WHO by member states on the basis of IHR (2005) requirements, using the Annex 2 decision instrument (

 </xref>), were included in the study. Third, the application of right censoring at the end of the study may have affected the results, especially for time to end of outbreaks in 2019, although the difference is unlikely to be substantial because relatively few events were right censored.
