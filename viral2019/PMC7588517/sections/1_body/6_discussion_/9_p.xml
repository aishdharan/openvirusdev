<p>In spite of these limitations, our study shows that outbreak metrics can be collected and measured to allow countries to monitor the timeliness of outbreak detection and response and provides an estimate of improvement of outbreak detection and end over time. The next step is to enable countries to set up systems in which these measurements are routinely collected, analyzed, and used to improve surveillance and response interventions. </p>
