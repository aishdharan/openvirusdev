<p>Rhinovirus (RV) is a non-enveloped single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Enterovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family. It is a highly contagious and ubiquitous virus. Its transmission generally occurs through direct exposure to respiratory droplets/micro-droplets, even though it can also take place via contaminated surfaces, including direct person-to-person contact [

RV represents the main responsible agent of “common colds”, mostly characterized by rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and diffuse malaise. RV can also cause many other upper and lower respiratory tract infections, such as otitis media, croup, pneumonia, and acute bronchiolitis [
