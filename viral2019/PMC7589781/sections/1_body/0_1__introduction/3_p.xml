<p>During the last 20 years, the methodologies for virus detection—immunofluorescence assay, but also molecular investigations, such as polymerase chain reaction—have improved, increasing the knowledge of the viral agents responsible for acute bronchiolitis. These techniques have led to the identification of the main responsible pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), accounting for 70–80% of bronchiolitis, followed by RV [

Other viruses, such as adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and human coronavirus, are less frequently implicated. Up to 30% of hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis have multiple respiratory virus co-infections [

Some viruses might be detected because of colonization, prolonged viral-shedding post-infection, or incubation before clinical infection. Indeed, respiratory viruses have been found in up to 40% of asymptomatic children. According to this finding, the interpretation of multiple coexisting viruses in symptomatic subjects should be interpreted with caution.
