<p>Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific viral pathogens and bronchiolitis CSI based on different symptoms and signs, mainly heart and respiratory rate, clinical signs of respiratory distress, the difficulty in feeding, and oxygen saturation [

 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-01620-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the majority of the studies reported that RV is associated with a milder CSI compared to other viral agents [
 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the single-center prospective study of Midulla and colleagues, enrolling 182 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, RV appeared to be associated with a lower CSI value at hospital admission when compared to other viral agents, firstly RSV (

 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, Miller and colleagues assessed the relationship between the viral pathogen and the bronchiolitis severity in 455 hospitalized infants over 4 years (2004â€“2008). They found that RV was related to a lower CSI when compared to other viral pathogens (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) [
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A similar result emerged when the same authors specifically compared RV and RSV bronchiolitis, concluding that RV was once again associated with lower CSI (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.013) [
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. On the contrary, the group of Papadopoulos found that RV was associated with the risk of a higher CSI at hospital admission when compared to other viral groups in 118 children with bronchiolitis, both at the univariate analysis (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) and multivariate analysis (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.022) [
 <xref rid="B15-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Corresponding results emerged from another single-center retrospective study analyzing data of 180 infants with bronchiolitis. However, in this study, RV infection was associated with a more severe CSI than the other viral types only at the univariate analysis (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.041), while no significant differences emerged at the multivariate logistic regression analysis [
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The more recent research focusing on this matter was the study retrospectively conducted by Petrarca et al. They enrolled 486 patients during 12 consecutive epidemic seasons without finding significant differences in CSI between RV and RSV-bronchiolitis [
