<p>The great heterogeneity of the reported results can be justified, at least in part, by the adoption of different CSIs that do not always consider the same parameters and whose pointâ€™s range significantly differ from each other. Moreover, many of these scores have not been formally validated, limiting their role in the assessment of the severity of bronchiolitis. Therefore, many authors have considered other more objective criteria for the evaluation of bronchiolitis severity, mainly represented by oxygen therapy, ventilatory support, LOS, and PICU admission.</p>
