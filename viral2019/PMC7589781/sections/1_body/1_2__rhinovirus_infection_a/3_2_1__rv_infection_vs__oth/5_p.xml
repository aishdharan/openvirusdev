<p>Analyzing the rate of admission to PICU in bronchiolitis, Bergroth et al. found that none of the 101 RV-infected patients of their cohort needed intensive care compared to 9% of the 145 RSV-bronchiolitis (

In 2018, Praznik and colleagues conducted a retrospective single-center study analyzing the site management of 761 children with bronchiolitis (138 treated as outpatients, 599 treated in the standard hospital setting, 24 admitted to PICU). Besides, in this study, no differences regarding the causative viruses were found [
