<p>When taken all into account, these findings seem to support the milder severity course of RV bronchiolitis in comparison with the illness of other viral pathogens, especially RSV. However, it is important to consider the heterogeneity of the reported studies—from the study design (retrospective vs. prospective, case-control. or cross-sectional) to the cohort’s inclusion criteria (such as age, &lt;1 year vs. &lt;2 years)—which may limit the relevance of these results. In particular, the age could represent an important factor, influencing RV and RSV severity. Indeed, RSV dominates in young infants, whereas the prevalence of RV bronchiolitis increases steadily with age [
