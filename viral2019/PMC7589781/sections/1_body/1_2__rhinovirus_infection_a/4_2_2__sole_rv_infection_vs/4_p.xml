<p>Mansbachet al. described data on 2207 children with bronchiolitis, of which 658 were with multiple infections. They compared RV single infection with RSV single infection, RV + RSV co-infection, RV + non-RSV co-infection, and RSV + non-RV co-infection. This study did not find any significant differences in terms of ventilatory support (intended as CPAP and/or intubation requirement) and admission to PICU but reported the association between RV + RSV co-infection and longer LOS (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Regarding this peculiar result, the authors suggested that it could be determined by the specific inflammatory property of RSV, which tends to reduce interferon (IFN)-Î³ response during infection, possibly allowing an enhancement of RV replication. Another suggested hypothesis is that RSV-infected endothelial cells increase the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression, the major receptor for RV, setting the stage for a more severe RV infection [
