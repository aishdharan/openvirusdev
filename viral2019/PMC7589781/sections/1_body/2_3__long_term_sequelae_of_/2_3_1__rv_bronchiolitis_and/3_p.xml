<p>Finally, Hunderi and colleagues conducted a prospective multicenter study enrolling 294 hospitalized children with moderate-severe bronchiolitis [
 <xref rid="B48-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Recurrent wheeze was defined as â‰¥3 episodes of wheezing, including the bronchiolitis at the enrollment. The authors found that recurrent wheezing at the age of two years was not significantly associated with RV or RSV infection, with the RV type or with the viral load during acute bronchiolitis. These results contrasted with previous studies and did not support the hypothesis that RV infection in susceptible infants may predispose to the development of wheezing [
