<p>Unlike other respiratory viruses, such as RSV, RV does not have a cytopathic effect and is not able to cause direct airway epithelial cell destruction. However, it alters the epithelial barrierâ€™s function, dissociating the zonula occludens-1 from tight junction complex through the release of reactive oxygen species during viral replication [
 <xref rid="B50-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This alteration can allow the absorption of higher amounts of aeroallergens, strictly related to the development of wheezing and asthma [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, different RV types use several specific vehicles to enter into airway epithelium: RV-A and -B types use ICAM-1 or the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), while recently, the cadherin-related family member 3 has been identified as a receptor for RV-C [

 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These different ways of access may partially justify the recurrent finding that RV-A and RV-C are more often associated with wheezing in asthma exacerbations [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-01620" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Another peculiar aspect concerns the genetic variations at locus 17q21, which are related to the risk of asthma. Indeed, early-life respiratory wheezing illnesses are a stronger risk factor for asthma in children with 17q21 locus risk variants than in children without it, and this is more evident for episodes triggered by RV than RSV [
