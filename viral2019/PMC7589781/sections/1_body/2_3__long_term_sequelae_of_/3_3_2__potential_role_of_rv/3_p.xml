<p>However, exposure to RV does not lead to asthma in all children, suggesting that personal risk factors (genetic, allergy, and antiviral immunity) and environmental exposure (farm, urban, microbes, and nutrition) also play a role. It remains to be elucidated whether RV bronchiolitis contributes to asthma development or is a marker of asthma susceptibility. In this sense, RV may be a revealing factor for those with early airway inflammation (i.e., epithelial barrier dysfunction, Th2 polarized inflammation), low IFN responses (i.e., impaired viral defense), and/or genetic variations (i.e., virus-specific risk genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms), acting as a clinically useful risk marker of asthma [
