<p>Regarding the studies focused on the course of bronchiolitis, many of them have supported that RV is associated with milder disease severity in comparison with other viral pathogens, especially RSV. On the contrary, in the majority of cases, the comparison between sole RV bronchiolitis and multiple viral co-infections does not suggest any significant difference concerning the severity of illness. However, not all research studies are consistent with these results. Moreover, the great heterogeneity of the investigations—from study design to analyzed outcome (CSI, ventilatory support, PICU admission, and LOS)—implies a certain obstacle to any interpretation of the literature data. Comprehensively, the available data are insufficient to draw conclusions in this regard. Thus, to date, the detection of the responsible virus pathogen does not seem to significantly impact the prognosis of bronchiolitis. Future studies should focus on RV types and viral load, which may play a role in the clinical course of bronchiolitis.</p>
