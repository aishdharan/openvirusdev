<p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a quasi-enveloped, positive strand RNA virus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HEV is the causative agent of Hepatitis E, the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis both in resource poor and developed countries. Hepatitis E presents as a mostly asymptomatic or acute self-limiting disease with a mortality rate up to 3% in young adults [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However the mortality rate may reach 30% in pregnant women [
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, chronic hepatitis E infections may occur in high-risk groups such as immunocompromised individuals (e.g., transplant recipients), those with pre-existing liver disease, HIV-positive persons, and cancer patients [

 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A recent study estimates that 939 million people worldwide have been infected with HEV in the past and that 15â€“110 million people have recent or ongoing infections [
 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. According to the WHO, an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic hepatitis E cases occur each year in endemic areas with 44,000 related deaths [
