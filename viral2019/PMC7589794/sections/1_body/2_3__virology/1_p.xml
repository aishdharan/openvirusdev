<p>HEV particles have an icosahedral shape, are non-enveloped, and form virions with a diameter of about 27–34 nm [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The HEV genome is about 7.2 kb in size and consists of a 5′ UTR capped with 7-methylguanosine (M
 <sup>7</sup>G), followed by three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3). The 3′ UTR ends with a poly(A) tail (A
 <sub>n</sub>) like the eukaryotic mRNA structure. Viral replication starts with the translation of the ORF1-encoded non-structural polyprotein. An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) subsequently transcribes the full-length negative-sense RNA. This RNA serves as a template for the synthesis of two viral positive-sense RNAs in infected cells, a full-length genomic RNA, and a subgenomic RNA containing the capsid protein-encoding ORF2 and polyfunctional protein (PP)-encoding ORF3 [
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The genomic arrangement and the stages of viral genome replication and protein synthesis are visualized in
