<p>ORF1 encodes a non-structural polyprotein of varying length that consists of seven domains comprising a methyl transferase (Met), X and Y domains, a papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), a proline-rich hypervariable region (HVR), RNA helicase (Hel), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Of these seven, only the Met, Hel, and RdRp have been functionally well characterized [
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The complete function of all ORF1 domains is still not fully understood. In addition, whether it functions as a multi-domain polyprotein like a “Swiss army knife” or whether it needs to be cleaved for functional activity [
 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] is under debate and there is still no conclusive evidence that PCP has a protease function [
 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although ORF1 is essential for HEV replication, its HVR displays considerable sequence divergence even between isolates of the same virus genotype [
 <xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Size differences between different HEV genomes can be primarily attributed to the HVR region. Analysis of different patient derived HEV isolates revealed various strains that harbor insertions from other regions of the viral genome, or from human genes, within the HVR [
