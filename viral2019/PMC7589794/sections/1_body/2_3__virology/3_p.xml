<p>The ORF2 encodes for the capsid protein. Its N-terminal signal peptide shuttles it to the extracellular compartment. The ORF2 protein contains three potential

 <xref rid="B44-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The full-length ORF2 encodes 660aa; however, recent reports suggested that ORF2 protein is processed into at least two forms, including one or two forms of secreted glycoproteins that are not associated with infectious particles, and one unglycosylated form which is the structural component of infectious particles [

 <xref rid="B46-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. ORF2 has been well characterized for its usefulness in diagnostics and vaccines, including the vaccine Hecolin
