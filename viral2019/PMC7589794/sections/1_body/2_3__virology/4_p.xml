<p>The ORF3 protein is a polyfunctional 13-kDa protein of 113 (genotype 3) or 114aa (genotypes 1, 2, and 4). Computational homology scans did not reveal any domains comparable to other known viral proteins. It has been shown to bind to microtubules and be involved in particle assembly and egress by interaction with the tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein (TSG101), a key protein involved in the endosomal sorting complexes of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required to transport) transport pathway and involved in the budding of the viruses [
