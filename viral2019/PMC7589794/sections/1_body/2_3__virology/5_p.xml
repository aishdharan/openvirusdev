<p>HEV exists as quasi-enveloped viral particles in blood and cell culture supernatant and as non-enveloped virions in bile and feces [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. When they are shed into the environment, non-enveloped naked virions are enterically transmitted through contaminated water or food. So far, it is not well understood how HEV virions overcome the intestinal barrier and reach the liver. However, it is assumed that the virions first infect the enterocytes, where they multiply, and are excreted as quasi-enveloped virus particles into blood circulation, thus infecting hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B57-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. On their way through the bile duct, the envelope is stripped off and naked, and more infectious virions are again released via the stool [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].
