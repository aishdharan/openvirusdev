<p>Moreover, sporadic human infections with rat HEV

 <xref rid="B144-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. HEV epidemiology shows two differing patterns based on the global distribution of the

 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00856-f002">Figure 2</xref>). HEV-1 and HEV-2 genotypes are human pathogens that are mostly transmitted via the fecalâ€“oral route in resource poor countries, mainly through contaminated drinking water, with several cases of vertical transmission having also been described [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, infections with HEV-3 and HEV-4 are autochthonous in developed countries and mainly zoonotically acquired via consumption of contaminated food, but parenteral transmission via blood transfusions have also been described [
 <xref rid="B145-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Despite several HEV genotypes, only a single serotype has been reported, which simplifies seroprevalence studies, diagnosis, and vaccination [
 <xref rid="B146-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
