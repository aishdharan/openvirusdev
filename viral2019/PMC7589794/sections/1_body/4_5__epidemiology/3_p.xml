<p>The HEV-1 and HEV-2 genotypes are estimated to infect about 20 million people in resource poor countries, resulting in 3.3 million symptomatic cases and 44,000 deaths per year [

 <xref rid="B150-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. HEV-1 is the main cause of significant recurrent epidemics in resource poor countries in Africa and Asia and isolated small epidemics in Latin America, as well as large outbreaks in India [
