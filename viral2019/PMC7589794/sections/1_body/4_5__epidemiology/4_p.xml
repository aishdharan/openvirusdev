<p>HEV-3 and HEV-4 are zoonotically transmitted from pigs, wild boar, deer, and rabbits in developed countries [
 <xref rid="B157-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>], where pigs are the main reservoir, and autochthonous infections are caused by the consumption of undercooked meat [
 <xref rid="B158-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>] or contact with pigs and wild animals [
 <xref rid="B159-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Previously, the cause of HEV-induced hepatitis was considered a disease of resource poor countries, but it has become clear that HEV is also acquired locally in industrialized regions [
 <xref rid="B160-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>,
 <xref rid="B161-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. A recent review and meta-analysis lists seroprevalence rates of 0.04% to 52.5% in these countries, with the highest prevalence reported from France, Poland, and Denmark [
 <xref rid="B162-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. HEV is much more frequent than previously thought, with an estimated &gt;400.000 infections per year in Germany [
 <xref rid="B163-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. HEV-3 is common among pigs worldwide, which constitute the major reservoir for human infections [
 <xref rid="B164-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>,
 <xref rid="B165-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. HEV-4 is widely distributed in South and East Asia, where both wild and domesticated pigs serve as a reservoir [

 <xref rid="B166-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Infection rates are high in people over 50 years of age [

 <xref rid="B167-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>,
 <xref rid="B168-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>], and seroepidemiological studies found no significant differences in HEV-IgG seropositivity according to gender [
 <xref rid="B169-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. However, a recent study revealed that men were more frequently infected than women [
 <xref rid="B170-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Other HEV genotypes such as HEV-5 and -6 were found in wild boars, whereas HEV-7 and -8 are present in camels [

 <xref rid="B173-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. So far, only HEV-7 has shown a zoonotic potential associated with practices of camel meat consumption in the Middle East [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Sporadic reports of human infections with rat HEV (
 <italic>Orthohepevirus C</italic>) have also been reported [

 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. HEV genotypes are selective with unique transmission patterns, pathogenesis [
