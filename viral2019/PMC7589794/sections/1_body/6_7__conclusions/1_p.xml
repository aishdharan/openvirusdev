<p>Infection with hepatitis E virus is still an under-reported disease worldwide. However, awareness of the prevalence of this virus has grown exponentially in the last decades. Before and since its discovery, there had been numerous large-scale outbreaks in the developing world with tens of thousands of cases, demonstrating that HEV is the most common cause of viral hepatitis worldwide. While HEV-1 and HEV-2 occur mainly in waterborne epidemics in areas with insufficient hygienic conditions, sporadic cases of HEV-3 and HEV-4, which are transmitted zoonotically or via contaminated blood products in industrialized countries, have confirmed that HEV is not a health burden solely of resource poor regions. Although much effort has been put into elucidating the mechanisms of infection, replication, and pathology of the virus, many questions are still left unanswered, underlining the importance of further research on its virology. This is especially important as hepatitis E infections—depending on the genotype—can cause severe liver disease in risk groups such as pregnant women and immunocompromised persons. With these aspects in mind, it is clear that further research is vital to develop more effective treatment options and approved vaccination strategies.</p>
