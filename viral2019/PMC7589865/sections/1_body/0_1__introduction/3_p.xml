<p>In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the population exposure, health risks, and driving factors of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> nationwide during the COVID-19 epidemic has been conducted by using high-precision spatiotemporal data. To be specific, the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) is used to analyze the patterns of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in China in both the temporal and spatial dimensions. Then, high-precision LBS data are used to explore the potential relationship between Chinese population and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to quantitatively assess the corresponding health risk. In order to quantify the driving factors of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> that impact health risk, this study uses geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to quantify the relationship between POI and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. This study expects to provide comprehensive reference and decision making for better protecting the ecological environment.
