<p>This study focuses on the following four parts: (1) through spatial autocorrelation analysis and EOF decomposition, discussing the temporal and spatial characteristics of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration; (2) based on the spatiotemporal distribution of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, calculating the population exposure of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> based on Tencent LBS data during the COVID-19 epidemic; (3) adopting the long-term health assessment method of air quality recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess the health risk of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> during the COVID-19 epidemic; (4) the relationship between PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and its driving factors were quantitatively analyzed using the GWR method to address the health threat posed by PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> to human beings, and relevant measures are proposed to address these driving factors.
