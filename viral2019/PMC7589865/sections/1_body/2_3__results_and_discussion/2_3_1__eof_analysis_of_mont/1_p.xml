<p>This study used the EOF spatiotemporal decomposition of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> station observations from 367 cities during 2014â€“2019 to reveal the spatial and temporal patterns of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. Because the first feature vector has a cumulative contribution of variance greater than 70% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f002">Figure 2</xref>), it was chosen to characterize the spatial pattern of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration.
