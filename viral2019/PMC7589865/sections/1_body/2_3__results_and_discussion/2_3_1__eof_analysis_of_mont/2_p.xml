<p>The time series coefficient reflects the variations of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration over time. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the change in time series coefficients corresponding to the PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> eigenvector for each month during the six-year period of 2014–2019. The time series coefficients of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration have the same changing trend, and the difference between months is significant, with the peak intervals located in the month of January from 2015–2019. The valley value of the time series coefficient of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration is located in August 2014, August 2015, August 2016, August 2017, September 2018 and August 2019. Overall, the time series coefficients for each year show a U-shaped distribution characteristic of increase after an initial decrease. In China, precipitation is scarce in January, February and December each year, and the phenomenon of “temperature inversion” is prominent, which seriously hinders the horizontal transportation and vertical diffusion of air, and easily causes pollutants to gather in the surface layer, making PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> pollution more serious [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Meanwhile, the temperature in January, February, and December is low, and people use more electricity to keep warm. Insufficient combustion of fossil fuels by facilities such as thermal power plants and coal furnaces causes a substantial increase in PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, the large amount of straw burning also contributes to a high concentration of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. According the variation of time series coefficient from 2014–2019, values of 2018 and 2019 are relatively low, indicating that PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration declined significantly from 2018.
