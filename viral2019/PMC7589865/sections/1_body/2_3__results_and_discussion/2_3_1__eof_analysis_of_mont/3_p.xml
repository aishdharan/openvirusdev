<p>The spatial distribution of the EOF first feature vector reflects the overall spatial distribution characteristics of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations on the monthly scale. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f004">Figure 4</xref>, it can be seen that the high PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration areas in China in 2014 were mainly concentrated in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration and Heilongjiang Province, and the high PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration areas from 2015 to 2019 were concentrated in Hebei Province, Henan Province, and Hubei Province and the spatial distribution of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration sprawling from the area to its surroundings. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration, Henan, and Shandong Province are located in the lower elevation plain, and surrounded by mountains, which are not conducive to the atmospheric transmission of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. In addition, the irrational industrial structure within these regions leads to the emission of endogenous pollutants [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Since 2015, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region (XAR) started to appear as the region of second highest PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration, with peaks in Urumqi and Kashgar in 2019. On the one hand, because XAR is far from the ocean, precipitation is scarce, and it has Chinaâ€™s largest desert, the Taklamakan Desert, whose wind fields basically dominate in the low precipitation and drought of XAR [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. On the other hand, the population of XAR is growing rapidly, and at a rate higher than the national average [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Increasing winter heating facilities and population growth has had a serious impact on the fragile environment of the XAR, which causes serious PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> pollution. In addition, there are many mines around Urumqi. With the development of Midong District, high-pollution industries such as petrochemicals, chlor-alkali chemicals, coal, electricity and coal chemicals have gathered here [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and large freight vehicles have a large traffic flow, which is affected by secondary particles and coal. The impact of smoke and vehicle emissions is greater, resulting in serious PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> pollution around Urumqi. PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations reached troughs in southwest Yunnan Province, southwest Sichuan Province, Tibet Autonomous Region, and southeast coastal areas. On the one hand, the underdeveloped economy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) and low industrial output (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>d) in these regions are the predominant reasons. On the other hand, the terrain of these areas is rugged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), and the primary industry, tertiary industry service industry and tourism are mainly developed, which have less impact on PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, so the level of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> pollution in these areas is low.
