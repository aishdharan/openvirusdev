<p>In March 2020, the scope of the region of maximum population density compared to January 2020. The region of greatest values is concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. As a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, the number of COVID-19 infected patients in the country peaked in March 2020, while there were no large number of new suspected infections, access to various community units in the country was strictly controlled, and road, railway and air transport authorities also took corresponding measures to restrict population movement. Enterprises in some cities gradually resumed work and production in March, but employees had to be quarantined for 14 days for observation before resuming work and production, resulting in lower urban population density in first-tier and new first-tier cities in China. In April 2020, the maximum population density areas of large cities were concentrated in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomerations, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration, Wuhan and Changsha, with an increasing trend compared to March 2020, but there is still a gap compared to the population density in January 2020, and with the stateâ€™s push for enterprises to resume work and production, most of the enterprises have started production activities in April 2020, and the population density range has an increasing trend in the first-tier and new first-tier cities. In general, the more densely populated areas are mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, etc.), the Pearl River Delta (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Macao Special Administrative Region of China, etc.), the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, etc.), and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration (Chongqing, Chengdu, Mianyang, etc.). The total economic output and per capita GDP are relatively high in the region. The population distribution throughout China is characterized by a relatively high concentration of people in the eastern part of the country and a relatively sparse population in the western part.</p>
