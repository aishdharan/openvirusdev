<p>At the end of 2019, a sudden outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic, bringing a heavy blow. From the comparison between 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b, the population density of Hubei changed greatly from 25 December 2019 to 11 January 2020, and the change in Wuhan City was particularly noticeable. The official report by the Wuhan Municipal Railway Bureau on 11 January 2020, the stations under the jurisdiction of the Wuhan Railway Bureau sent 570,000 passengers, including about 100,000 student passengers. As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f006">Figure 6</xref>c, the population density of Hubei has also declined significantly compared to January 2020, with the range of population density in Wuhan shrinking considerably. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the city of Wuhan has been blocked to management since 24 January 2020, and the degree of population movement has decreased, reducing the spatial range of the maximum value of population density in Wuhan. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f005">Figure 5</xref>d, the spatial extent of population density in cities of Hubei, except Wuhan, tends to expand, accompanied by a gradual intensification of population mobility with the resumption of work in Hubei.
