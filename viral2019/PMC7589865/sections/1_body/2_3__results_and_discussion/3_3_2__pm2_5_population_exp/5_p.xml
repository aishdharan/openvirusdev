<p>To further quantify the changes of the COVID-19 situation on PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure and the effectiveness of LBS data, data analysis on five typical population-intensive cities of China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Wuhan) was performed, in which the daily PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> ground monitoring station data [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], demographic data and LBS data were used. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f006">Figure 6</xref>, green curves are daily PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure based on demographic data for the period of December 2019 to April 2020 (the duration of COVID-19); by contrast, blue curves are the reference of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure using historical average data (December 2014 to April 2019); marks (red star) represent LBS-based PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure on four dates mentioned above.
