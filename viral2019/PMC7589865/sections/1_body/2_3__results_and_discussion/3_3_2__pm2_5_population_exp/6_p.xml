<p>The influence of the COVID-19 situation on air pollution can be concluded by the comparison of demographic-based PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure, i.e., the result in the duration of COVID-19 (green curve) and the result in the historical average (blue curve). Take Wuhan for example, as show in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f006">Figure 6</xref>e, we found that the PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic saw a significantly drop due to the community containment measures. Similarly, cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, follow the same pattern. The effectiveness of LBS data can be concluded by the comparison of demographic-based PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure in the duration of COVID-19 (green curve) and LBS-based PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure on four dates (red star). Although we only obtained LBS data at four key time nodes because of access restrictions, the trend of LBS-based PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure (red star) is consistent with demographic-based PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure (green curve) in these cities. It demonstrates that LBS data on four key dates can characterize the variation of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure well during the COVID-19 pandemic.
