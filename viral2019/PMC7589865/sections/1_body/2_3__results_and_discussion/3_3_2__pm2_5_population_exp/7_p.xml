<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the areas with the highest exposure values on 25 December 2019 occurred in Henan, Hebei, Beijing, the northwestern part of Shandong, the Pearl River Delta, Chengdu, Chongqing, and the capital cities of the Northeast, the exposure values of other cities are relatively low. The areas with the largest exposure values on 11 January 2020 were mainly concentrated in Henan, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, and the Pearl River Delta. The area with the highest PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure on 7 March 2020 appeared around Shanghai. The maximum value on 3 April 2020 appeared in the Pearl River Delta, Wuhan and surrounding areas of Shanghai. According to the trend of the exposure values of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> from December 2019 to April 2020, it can be seen that the exposure values of large cities such as the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration, the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration have maintained at a relatively high level. From December 2019 to April 2020 in these regions, the exposure of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> gradually decreased. Because these areas were central cities for economic development, with a large population density and dense urban space, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> is difficult to diffuse, the values of exposure are large. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f007">Figure 7</xref>a,b, the PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure in large cities in January 2020 is lower than that in December 2019. It is related to the Spring Festival travel. With the migration of the population, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration relatively reduced. Combined with the spatial distribution of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, the reason for the decrease in the exposure of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> in March 2020 compared with January 2020 is related to the control measures issued by government in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. When the COVID-19 occurred, all provinces across the country (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) launched a first-level emergency response to major public health emergencies. All communities, streets, villages, and towns across the country have implemented community isolation through grid management, and the flow of people has been greatly reduced. In addition, the provinces announced that in addition to guaranteeing the operation of public utilities (e.g., water supply, gas supply, power supply, communication and other industries), epidemic prevention and control (e.g., medical equipment, medicines, protective products production and sales), the people’s daily life (e.g., supermarket stores, food production and supply and other industries) and other enterprises other than those related to important national economy and people’s livelihood are all shut down. PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure was enhanced in April 2020 compared to March 2020, particularly in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Yunnan and the Pearl River Delta, due to the fact that with the vast majority of the country’s enterprises’ after more than a month of adjustment, most companies have regained their original capacity, accompanied by the population movement caused by the resumption of production and the enhanced plant emissions led to an uptick in PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure in April 2020.
