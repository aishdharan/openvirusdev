<p>The results are based on the health risk assessment of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, and the potential risks of disease from PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> shown in the study results all exclude diseases due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> health risks in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f008">Figure 8</xref>) show that the maximum potential death toll in December 2019 was 139,424, and the areas with high PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> health risks cover the largest area. In March 2020 and April 2020, the impact of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> was lower than that in December 2019 and January 2020. In April 2020, areas with high health risks covered the lowest area, and the maximum potential death toll was 33,462. Compared with the decrease of 105,962 people in December 2019, the decline was relatively large. In terms of geographical distribution, the health risks of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> in the western region are significantly lower than those in the central and eastern regions. The areas with higher PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> health risks are mainly concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Henan, Chengdu, Chongqing, Pearl River Delta, northwestern XAR and Shanghai. According to the population density map based on LBS data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f005">Figure 5</xref>), the population during the Spring Festival transport in 2020 will migrate from first-tier cities and new first-tier cities to small cities. According to data from the Beijing Railway Administration, during the Spring Festival travel period, Beijing sent a total of 8,274,100 passengers, and the population density in Beijing decreased. Population migration has reduced the population density of first-tier cities and new first-tier cities, reducing PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> exposure and reducing the health risks caused by PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. With the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic, communities across the country were blocked between the end of January 2020 and March 2020, traffic on the roads was reduced, airports, railway stations and other places of passenger access were strictly controlled, and population movement was reduced, resulting in a reduced health risk from PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>.
