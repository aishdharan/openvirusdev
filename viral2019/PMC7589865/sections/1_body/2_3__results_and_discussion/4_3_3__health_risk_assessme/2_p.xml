<p>The health risk caused by PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> was low in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai, western Sichuan, northwestern Gansu, and central XAR. The COVID-19 epidemic did not have a significant impact on the health risk of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. From the topography (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f005">Figure 5</xref>) of the study area, it can be found that these areas have complex topography and a large degree of undulation, which are not suitable for human habitation, making the population density lower and the health risk caused by lower PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in these areas smaller. In addition, the GDP per capita (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) in these regions is low, and the output value of the secondary industry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>d) is also low, making economic development relatively backward. Moreover, these regions have primary agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, and tertiary tourism as the pillar industries of their economies, and there is little air pollution caused by PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> from large industries, so the health risk caused by PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> is relatively low.
