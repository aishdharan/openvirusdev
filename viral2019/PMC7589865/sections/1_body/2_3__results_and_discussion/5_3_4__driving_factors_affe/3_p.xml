<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f009">Figure 9</xref>a, the national PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration and GDP show a negative correlation (
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-07664-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), indicating that the GDP is high and the corresponding PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration is low. The most obvious performance is the urban agglomeration in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with the largest absolute value of the regression coefficient. The higher the total urban GDP is, the more attention is paid to the reduction of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> pollution. Regression coefficients ranged from −10 to −5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> in areas such as Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and central Inner Mongolia, where industry is underdeveloped (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>d), the economy is mainly based on primary and tertiary services, and urban PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> emissions are low, so GDP and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> show a strong negative correlation. In the southern part of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the three provinces of Northeast China, with correlation coefficients between 0 and 5, as the output value of secondary industries in these regions was larger (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>d), and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> emissions from factories were higher, so GDP showed a weak positive correlation with PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>.
