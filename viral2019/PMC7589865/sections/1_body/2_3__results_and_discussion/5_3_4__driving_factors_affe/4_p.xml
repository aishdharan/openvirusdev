<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f009">Figure 9</xref>b, urban green areas in South China, East China, Central China, North China, Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration showed negative correlation with PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, with correlation coefficients between −5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> and 0, indicating that the larger the urban green area, the lower the urban PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration. Green plants can not only absorb air pollutants such as dust, sulfide, nitrous oxide, etc., but also the coronal layer of the plant will reduce the speed of wind and block particles in the air. Plant leaves will absorb dust during respiration and photosynthesis. Official data assumes that in an acre of forest planted with 100 trees, 22−60 tons of dust can be absorbed in a year [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-07664" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As a result, urban greenery has a stronger cleaning and air purification function. In the southwest and the west, except for most of the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration and the northwest, there is a weak positive correlation between the urban green area and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, and the correlation coefficient is between 0 and 5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>. Since these areas are located in the first and second terrain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), the climatic conditions and precipitation conditions are not conducive to large-scale vegetation growth. Most vegetation types are grasslands and low shrubs, and the absorption effect of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> is significantly weak, while the absorption intensity of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> by tall vegetation are intensive in the eastern region [
