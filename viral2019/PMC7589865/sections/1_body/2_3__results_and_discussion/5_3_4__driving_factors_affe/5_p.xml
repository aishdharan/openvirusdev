 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f009">Figure 9</xref>c–e, road area and the numbers of urban taxis and buses show a positive correlation with PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration (
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-07664-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The average regression coefficient between road area and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> is between 0 and 5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> The population density of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, western Yunnan and Tibet Autonomous Region is low due to topography (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), climate, and other factors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The roads are scattered, giving the road area and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> a positive correlation. The regression coefficients for the number of urban taxis and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> ranged from −5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 0, with a weak negative correlation in Northeast China, where industry contributed the most to PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> due to the concentrated distribution of heavy industry in the region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>d). The regression coefficient between the number of urban buses and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> is from 0 to 5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> and the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration has a strong positive correlation with Shanxi and eastern Inner Mongolia, with the regression coefficient from 5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 10 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>. Road area is proportional to urban traffic emissions, with higher emissions (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, etc.) from urban traffic with major road. According to the China Mobile Source Environmental Management Annual Report (2019) released by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China has been the world’s largest producer and seller of motor vehicles for 10 consecutive years and, in 2018, the total amount of four pollutants emitted from motor vehicles in the country was initially accounted for 40.653 million tons. This includes 442,000 tons of particulate matter. Automobiles are the main contributors to air pollution emissions from motor vehicles [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) resulted in a weak negative correlation between the number of bus and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>.
