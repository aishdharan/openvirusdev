<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f009">Figure 9</xref>f there is a significant positive correlation between the number of factories in Central, North, Southwest and Northwest China on PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, with regression coefficients between 0 and 20 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>, with the strongest correlation in Shanxi and Central Inner Mongolia. The distribution of secondary industry values in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-07664-f001">Figure 1</xref>d) shows that these regions have higher secondary industry emissions. The greater the number of urban factories, the higher the emissions of pollutants (nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, etc.) resulting from the factories’ production activities. The spatial regression coefficients of the number of factories and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> show an increasing trend from east to west of China, while the South China show a weak negative correlation trend, indicating that South China pays attention to the emission of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> from factories. Meanwhile, South China is close to the ocean, and the PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration generated by factories is positively influenced by the sea breeze that accompanies the ocean currents [
