<p>The quantitative analysis of the driving factors of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> found that the number of urban factories has the greatest impact on PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, indicating that industrial emissions dominated the China’s PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> pollution. In terms of reducing the health risks and pollution prevention measures caused by PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, industrial emissions should be controlled. Launching laws and regulations for PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> prevention and control, and formulating relevant standards for industrial waste gas and waste emissions from factories, is necessary. The relevant departments should ensure the implementation of the system. The government promotes the location of new factory sites, increases planning for PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> prevention and control in industrial parks, and provides technical support for replacing new clean equipment in factories, while the authorities will increase the supply of clean energy such as electricity and natural gas to reduce reliance on traditional energy sources in factories and reduce PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> emissions. Vegetation coverage is an important part of urban ecological construction. Relevant planning departments should make reasonable plans for vegetation planting areas around factories and inside cities to prevent the spread of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> from further harming surrounding residents’ health, because trees play a unique ecological function in the purification of atmospheric fine particles.
