 <p id="Par1">HIV-1 diversity may impact monitoring and vaccine development. We describe the most recent data of HIV-1 variants and their temporal trends in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from 1976 to 2018 and in Kinshasa from 1983–2018. HIV-1 
  <italic>pol</italic> sequencing from dried blood collected in Kinshasa during 2016–2018 was done in 340 HIV-infected children/adolescents/adults to identify HIV-1 variants by phylogenetic reconstructions. Recombination events and transmission clusters were also analyzed. Variant distribution and genetic diversity were compared to historical available 
  <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the DRC in Los Alamos Database (LANL). We characterized 165 HIV-1 
  <italic>pol</italic> variants circulating in Kinshasa (2016–2018) and compared them with 2641 LANL sequences from the DRC (1976–2012) and Kinshasa (1983–2008). During 2016–2018 the main subtypes were A (26.7%), G (9.7%) and C (7.3%). Recombinants accounted for a third of infections (12.7%/23.6% Circulant/Unique Recombinant Forms). We identified the first CRF47_BF reported in Africa and four transmission clusters. A significant increase of subtype A and sub-subtype F1 and a significant reduction of sub-subtype A1 and subtype D were observed in Kinshasa during 2016–2018 compared to variants circulating in the city from 1983 to 2008. We provide unique and updated information related to HIV-1 variants currently circulating in Kinshasa, reporting the temporal trends of subtypes/CRF/URF during 43 years in the DRC, and providing the most extensive data on children/adolescents.
