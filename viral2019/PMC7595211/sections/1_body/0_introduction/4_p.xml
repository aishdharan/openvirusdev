<p id="Par6">Accordingly, Kinshasa is one of the most relevant places to carry out surveillance programs to increase the knowledge of HIV molecular epidemiology and viral evolution. In that context, our study presents the most recent data related to current circulating HIV-1 variants in 
 <italic>pol</italic> in Kinshasa during the 2016–2018 period, identifying transmission clusters and updating the genetic diversity. In addition, we present a complete review of HIV-1 variant trends in the DRC over 43 years (1976–2018) after using all the historical 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences available in Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (LANL) from samples collected in the DRC. We reclassified all HIV-1 variants after new phylogenetic analysis in all downloaded 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences, including the most recent subtype L and new CRF described in the last years. Later we studied the temporal trends of HIV-1 variants in the DRC and Kinshasa considering the sampling year of each sequence.
