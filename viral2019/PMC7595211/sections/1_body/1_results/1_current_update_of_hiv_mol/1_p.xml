<p id="Par7">We obtained viral 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences (115 protease, PR, 139 retrotranscriptase, RT and 115 integrase, IN) from 165 (48.5%) of 340 HIV-infected children/adolescents (55, 33.3%) and adults (110, 66.7%) from two hospitals in Kinshasa (DRC) with dried blood specimens (DBS) collected during 2016–2018 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Thus, our study was done in 165 patients with available 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence. The median age [IQR] at DBS collection for children and adults was 14.4 [11.4–16.8] and 43 [34–53.5] years old, respectively. Around 75% of subjects with available 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence were under antiretroviral treatment (ART) and 8 out of 10 presented more than 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml at sampling (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
