<p id="Par8">From the historical database, we recovered 5672 group M 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences without gaps or ambiguities available in LANL, 4090 of them being assigned to HIV-1 pure subtypes (300 A, 2476 B, 1133 C, 72 D, 48 F, 45 G, 7 H, 5 J, 1 K, 3 L) and 1582 circulating recombinants forms CRF_01 to CRF_99. As expected, most (99.4%) viral sequences from the 165 subjects were classified as HIV-1 non-B variants in 
 <italic>pol</italic> coding region. Among them, 59.4% were 9 pure non-B subtypes, 36.4% recombinant forms (23.7% URFs and 12.7% CRFs) and 3.6% unique unclassificable (U) sequences. The most frequent HIV-1 variant was subtype A (26.7%), followed by subtypes G (9.7%) and C (7.3%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The most prevalent CRF were CRF45_cpx (2.4%), CRF02_AG (1.8%) and CRF27_cpx (1.8%) in our cohort. Interestingly, we identified for the first time the CRF47_BF variant in the DRC, infecting an 8 year-old child. Among recombinant forms, URF accounted for 65% of infections in our study cohort (2016–2018). These URF were in circulation in Kinshasa during 2016–2018. Recombination patterns in the analyzed 
 <italic>pol</italic> fragments assigned to URF among the 39 subjects is described in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. When specific HIV-1 variants were compared between age groups, adults presented a greater number of different CRF (11 variants) than children/adolescent group (2 CRF: CRF27_cpx and CRF47_BF). Althought the children/adolescent group presented less diversity, they had almost 3 times as many URF infections than adults (40% vs. 14.5%; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The rate of pure subypes was similar across both groups.
