<p id="Par10">Among the 165 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Kinshasa we identified 4 independent transmission clusters (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) supported by 100% bootstrap, presenting recent transmission (genetic distance lower than 0.01) in three of them: cluster 1, cluster 3 and cluster 4. Infected individuals from clusters 1, 2 and 3 carried subtype A 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences, although they were not ascribed to previously characterized sub-subtypes A or CRF including A at 
 <italic>pol</italic> coding region. They appeared in 3 different branches in PhyML trees after including all LANL sequences ascribed to subtype A and their sub-subtypes circulating in the DRC since 1976 (Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Subjects from cluster 4 harbored subtype H viruses, clustering apart from other subtype H LANL sequences from the DRC (Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the epidemiological data collected from clinical reports of each patient. All clusters included 2 subjects, except cluster 1 including a 34.7 year-old woman, a 6.2 year-old boy and a 14.3 year-old adolescent male with no reported epidemiological link (Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Clusters 2 and 3 included two adults and cluster 4 two children.
