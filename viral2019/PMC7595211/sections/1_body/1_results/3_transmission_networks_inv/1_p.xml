<p id="Par11">Among the 165 new sequences (2016–2018), we found the presence of a transmission network, including two different clusters (RecG and RecB) of 17 viruses sharing one
 <italic> pol</italic> fragment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Interestingly, all viruses involved were collected from paediatric patients with no epidemiological linkage according to clinical reports. Cluster RecB included viruses sharing a fragment of 599 nt in RT (positions 2935–3534 in HXB2) assigned to subtype B, in 8 patients ranging from 9 to 18 years-old. Cluster RecG included viruses from 9 adolescents from 10 to 19 years-old sharing a fragment in IN (positions 4390–5005 in HXB2) of 615 nt assigned to subtype G (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Of note, one 
 <italic>pol </italic>sequence from a 19 year-old female (18.RDC_P83) shared fragments of both clusters (Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The common progenitor viruses for clusters RecG and RecB using PhyML trees were not found in all 2802 LANL sequences from the DRC. We also observed a recombination event at protease coding region involving viruses from 2 adults (subtype A, CUN131 and subtype H, CUN127), leading to URF_A virus infecting CUN123 (Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).
