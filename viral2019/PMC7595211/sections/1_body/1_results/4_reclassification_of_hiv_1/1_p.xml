<p id="Par12">In order to increase the number of 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the DRC, we downloaded all 2802 available 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences in LANL, which had been collected since 1976 to 2012, mainly (99.9%) from adults (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Then, since new HIV-1 variants have appeared in the recent years, we reclassified the 2641 pure subtypes and CRF, excluding 161 URF, performing the same PhyML analysis and reference sequences set in the historic LANL database from the DRC as in our sequences collected in Kinshasa from 2016–2018. Interestingly, we found some discrepancies in the HIV-1 variant classification in 8.8% (198 sub-subtype A1 and 34 U) of them, which had probably been misclassified due to less available reference HIV-1 sequences and to the absence of new subtypes and new CRF when they were classified. The new PhyML analysis revealed that 198 (32.9%) of the 602 sequences originaly appointed as sub-subtype A1 in LANL were, in fact, other HIV-1 variants, 101 being subtype A (51%), 88 CRF02_AG (44.4%), 3 CRF11_cpx (1.5%), 3 CRF25_cpx (1.5%), 1 sub-subtype A6 (0.5%), 1 sub-subtype F1 (0.5%) and 1 U (0.5%). Among the 34 (26.6%) of 128 U LANL sequences from the DRC, 12 turned out to be subtype A (35.3%), 4 sub-subtype F1 (11.8%), 3 sub-subtype A4 (8.8%), 3 sub-subtype A5 (8.8%), 3 subtype D (8.8%), 3 CRF18_cpx (8.8%), 2 subtype K (5.9%), 1 CRF02_AG (2.9%), 1 subtype G (2.9%), 1 subtype H (2.9%), and 1 (0.5%) subtype L. Thus, one third (32.9%) of sub-subtype A1 and a quarter (26.6%) of U LANL sequences from the DRC had been previously misclassified.
