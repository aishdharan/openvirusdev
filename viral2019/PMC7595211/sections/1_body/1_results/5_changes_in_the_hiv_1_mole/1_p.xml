<p id="Par13">In order to analyze the HIV-1 molecular epidemiology evolution over time in the DRC, we compared the current HIV-1 variants in 
 <italic>pol</italic> circulating in Kinshasa (2016–2018) with the 2588 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences previously reported in the country with known sampling year (1976–2012) and newly reclassified in this study. Globally, a significant reduction (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the percentage of pure subtypes and simultaneously an increase of URFs (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), were observed after comparing both periods, whereas the proportion of CRFs remained similar across both sequence sets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, B). The evolution of pure subtypes and recombinant forms in the DRC across a three-year period until 2018 is shown in Fig.
