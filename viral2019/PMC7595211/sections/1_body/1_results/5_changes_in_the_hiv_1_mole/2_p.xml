<p id="Par14">HIV-1 variant distribution varies greatly between provinces and it is not possible to compare the diversity in Kinshasa with that of the whole country. We therefore performed a new analysis using all available 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences deposited in LANL recovered from samples collected in Kinshasa after identifying the accession numbers in the corresponding papers, recovering 181 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from different subjects. We then compared the HIV-1 variant distribution in Kinshasa from the 181 samples collected exclusively in the city during 1983–2008 (94.5% of them sampled during 2007–2008) versus the new 165 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences collected during 2016–2018 in Kinshasa and newly reported in this study. We observed during 2016–2018 a significant increase in subtype A (10.5% vs. 26.7%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and sub-subtype F1 (0% vs. 4.8%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and a significant reduction in sub-subtype A1 (11% vs. 0%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and subtype D (7.7% vs. 2.4%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to variants from Kinshasa circulating from 1983 to 2008, whereas the proportion of CRFs remained similar across both sequence sets (12.1 vs. 13.2%, respectively). We detected CRF47_BF virus for the first time in the country using 
 <italic>po</italic>l sequences collected after 2016. URF tended to decrease over time (31% vs. 23.6%). The remaining variants remained stable over time (Fig.
