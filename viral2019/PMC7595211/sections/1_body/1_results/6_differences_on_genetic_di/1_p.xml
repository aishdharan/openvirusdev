<p id="Par15">The global genetic diversity across the 2802 LANL 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences (1976–2012) versus our 165 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence set under study (2016–2018) reported similar values (0.90 vs. 0.91) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). However, considering specific HIV-1 variants, LANL set presented higher genetic diversity in pure-subtypes (0.84 vs. 0.76), whereas diversity of CRFs was higher since 2016 (0.78 vs. 0.89). When the genetic diversity was compared into the most recent sequences, according to age group, it was higher in children/adolescents than adults (0.92 vs. 0.88), mainly in URF variants (0.93 vs. 0.80), whereas in CRFs the diversity was higher in adults versus children/adolescents (0.88 vs. 0.50) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, shows the high genetic diversity over time in 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences sampled in the DRC since the 1976 (year of first available 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence) to 2018, with some variations by periods of time.
