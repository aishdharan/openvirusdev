<p id="Par25">In conclusion, we report the most recent data related to HIV-1 variants circulating in Kinshasa, the geographical origin of the pandemic, and unique and updated information on the temporal trends of HIV-1 subtypes, CRF and URF in the DRC during 43-year period (from 1976 to 2018) and in Kinshasa from 1983â€“2018 after reclassification of several available LANL sequences using phylogenetic approach. The data provided increase and update the knowledge of HIV molecular epidemiology in the DRC. Active transmission clusters were detected, and a new strategy offers us a more complete view of transmission networks. Of concern is an overrepresentation of children was observed in the recombination network. Continued molecular surveillance will be essential to determine and trace rare unique recombinant forms or emerging strains of HIV in the country.</p>
