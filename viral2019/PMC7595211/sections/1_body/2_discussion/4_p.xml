 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and not full genomes. Thus, the recombinant rate in the DRC could be even higher if more viral regions are assessed. Although the biological and clinical impact remains to be clarified, there is growing evidence that recombination has played a significant role in the early history of the HIV-1 pandemic and in viral evolution
