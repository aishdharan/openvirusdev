<p id="Par21">We also found that almost 4 out of 10 variants circulating in Kinshasa during both periods (1983–2008 and 2016–2018) carried recombinant sequences in 
 <italic>pol</italic>. When CRFs and URFs diversities were analysed according to age of patients, CRFs diversity in 
 <italic>pol</italic> was higher in adults and URF diversity higher in children/adolescents in the last period. The trends of HIV-1 genetic diversity should be further explored in the coming years, also including other HIV-1 genes. The high misclassification in sub-subtype A and U 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the DRC deposited in LANL reveals the need for reclassification by phylogeny with updated reference sequence sets and new reported HIV-1 variants.
