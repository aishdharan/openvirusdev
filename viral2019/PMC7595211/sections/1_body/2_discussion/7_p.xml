  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>
 </sup>). We implemented a strategy based on traceability of genetic fragments, to know the potential network among infected people (Sup. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). This strategy, “recombination network”, gave us a dense net and probably a more complete view. The recombination network found involving 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from 17 children/adolescents with no epidemiological link according to clinical data confirmed the important role of recombination in an HIV pandemic and the importance of common ancestor identification to understand recombination origin and spread. As the children are overrepresented in this network, we should suspect that this network is even denser.
