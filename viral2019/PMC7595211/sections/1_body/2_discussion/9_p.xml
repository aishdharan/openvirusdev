<p id="Par24">Since none of sequences downloaded form LANL was sampled after 2012, our sequence set was the most recent in the DRC to date and the highest in number of analyzed

Our study reinforces the use of dried blood as a field-friendly, useful, convenient and alternative specimen type to whole blood or plasma in HIV molecular epidemiology surveillance studies in developing countries or settings with limitations as regards the collection, storing, transportation of plasma or when low blood volume is available

The updated high genetic diversity observed in the DRC also represents a real challenge for future vaccine development and for efficiency of antiretroviral treatment, diagnostic and monitoring tests of HIV infection
