<p id="Par27">For HIV-1 variant characterization, viral RNA was extracted from 2 DBS dots using NucliSENS EeasyMAG automated platform (BioMerieux) or manual High-Pure Viral Nucleic Acid kit (Roche). The encoding regions PR, RT, and/or IN at HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene were amplified by RT-PCR and nested-PCR using primers designed by WHO

 </sup>. PCR amplicons were purified using the Illustra ExoProStar 1-Step (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) and sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Geumchun-gu, Seoul, Korea). Viral sequences included the complete HIV-1 PR (codons 1–99), partial RT (codons 1–335/440) and IN (codons 1–285).
