<p id="Par30">Transmission clusters in our 165 study sequences from Kinshasa (2006â€“2018) were defined as viral sequences belonging to the same subtype/CRF/URF and grouped into a single and well-supported cluster (monophyletic clade) with 100% bootstrap values. When only partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences could be recovered from new samples, each available sequence fragment present in all viruses from the cluster was used for analysis separately. In this way, new recombination events were detected. Sequences with different recombination events but sharing some recombinant fragment and common progenitor virus were considered as transmission networks.
