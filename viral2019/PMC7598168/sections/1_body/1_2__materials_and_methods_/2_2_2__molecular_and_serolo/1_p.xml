<p>The presence of antibodies against HIV-1/HIV-2 and yellow fever virus (YFV) was tested using the INSTI kit (Biolytical, Richmond, Canada) and ELISA (Pasteur Institute, Dakar, Senegal) respectively. The presence of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was tested using a rapid screening kit (CapitalBio Technology, Beijing, China). The presence of the Ebola virus (EBOV) and LASV was investigated by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Viral RNA was extracted from serum samples using the QIAmp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In Conakry, the EBOV test was carried out by real-time RT-PCR, using the RealStar
 <sup>®</sup> Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) on a Smart Cycler II system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The LASV test was carried out using a conventional RT-PCR targeting the glycoprotein (GP) with the primers LVS36+ (5′-ACCGGGGATCCTAGGCATTT-3′) and LVS339- (5′-GTTCTTTGTGCAGGAMAGGGGCATKGTCAT-3′) [

 <sup>®</sup> Lassavirus RT-PCR kit 2.0 (altona Diagnostics) on the Rotor-Gene Q platform (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was performed on the serum sample of the patient in our satellite laboratory in Gueckedou. The LASV-specific RT-PCR kit targets both the S- and L-segments of LASV.
