<p>The serum sample from the patient was dried on a filter paper and sent to the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany. Extraction and metagenomic library preparation for next generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina platform were performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted directly from dried serum on filter paper using the QIAmp viral RNA kit (Qiagen), further digested with DNAse (TURBO DNase, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, USA), randomly reverse-transcribed and amplified using a Sequence-Independent Single-Primer Amplification (SISPA) approach. The Illumina sequencing library was prepared using the Nextera XT v2 Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) with 1 ng of SISPA-amplified cDNA, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a total of 12 cycles in the library amplification PCR, and further sequenced on a 2 × 300 bp Illumina MiSeq run. Majority consensus was obtained with bases called at a minimum depth of 20x and a support fraction of 70%. Any base location that did not fulfil the depth and support fraction was assigned an “N” IUPAC ambiguity notation. The complete sequences were submitted to GenBank under the names and accession numbers LASV/GUI/KIS-2019-L-segment #MT861993 and LASV/GUI/KIS-2019-S-segment #MT861994.
