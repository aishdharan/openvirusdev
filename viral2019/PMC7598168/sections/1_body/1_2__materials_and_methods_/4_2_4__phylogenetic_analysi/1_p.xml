<p>The nucleotide sequences of full-length glycoprotein precursor (GPC), nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase (L) were aligned separately in three data sets including 41 sequences for each. The sequences were chosen to be representative of their clusters after a preliminary analysis done with 64 NP sequences only and elimination of similar or clone sequences. The alignment of nucleotides was realized according to the position of amino acids in the protein alignment. The phylogeny was inferred by the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in the BEAST software, version 1.10.1 [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With the view to performing a time-calibrated phylogeny, the parameters were set in BEAUTI as follow: the tip dates at the year level, the substitution model as GTR + gamma and codon partition with positions 1, 2, 3, the clock model as strict or uncorrelated relaxed. A coalescent tree with a constant size population was set as prior. The length of the chain was 10 million, with echo states and log parameters every 10,000 steps. The xml files issued from BEAUTI were run in BEAST and checked in TRACER. After checking the effective sample size to be above 200 for all the parameters, the consensus trees were obtained in TreeAnnotator, and then visualized through FigTree (BEAST packages,
