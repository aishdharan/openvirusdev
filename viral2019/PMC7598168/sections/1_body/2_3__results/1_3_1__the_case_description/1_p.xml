<p>On 7 January 2019, a 35-year-old man consulted a clinic in Kissidougou because of fever accompanied by chills, dizziness, very frequent bilious vomiting and joint pains. Malaria was diagnosed and the patient was treated with paracetamol and quinine. Despite complying with the malaria treatment, symptoms remained unchanged for one week. He returned to the same clinic, which further referred him to the regional hospital located in Kissidougou on 21 January 2019. At the end of the consultation, a diagnosis of malaria and typhoid fever was made. He received a perfusion and a recommendation of hospitalization was made. However, the patient refused to be hospitalized and came back home. After three days of treatment, and feeling that there was no improvement, he went to another health centre. Three days later, he decided to travel to Mamou, where he stayed two days with his family. Noting that there was no improvement in his status, his parents decided to bring him to the regional hospital of Mamou on 28 January 2019, where he was admitted at 2 p.m. to the emergency room at the Epidemic Treatment Centre (CT-EPI). At the time of admission, the symptoms were as follows: fever and chills, dizziness, vomiting, joint pain, diarrhoea and prostration. A diagnosis of severe malaria was given and he received an intensive supportive antimalarial treatment (rehydration, artesunate, ampicillin, paracetamol, dicynone). At 3 p.m., the patient started bleeding with a cough tinged with blood and the epistaxis started. The physician in charge of the intensive care unit raised the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) such as the Ebola virus disease. A blood sample was taken and packed for dispatch to the reference laboratory in Conakry. The patient died at 10 p.m. with a picture of toxic-infectious shock and diffuse bleeding. The body was transported to the morgue and transferred to the Red Cross for a dignified and secure burial. </p>
