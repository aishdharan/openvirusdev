<p>On 30 January 2020, the laboratory received the blood sample of the case and proceeded to various testing. Differential diagnosis included malaria, serology of HIV and YFV, and acute infection by HBV, EBOV and LASV. Only the presence of the LASV was confirmed on 30 January 2020 by conventional LASV RT-PCR. It was further re-tested by real-time LASV RT-PCR, and LASV Ct values of 36.0 for the S-segment and 24.5 for the L-segment were found. According to the equation of the standard curve for the GPC assay (y = 0.293x + 14.324 where y = log10 (RNA copies/mL plasma) and x = Ct), we can estimate the number of copies/mL to be 5.97E+03. The confirmation of a Lassa fever case launched field investigations and contact tracing activities. The investigation in Kissidougou revealed that the patient was an entrepreneur who was a timber trader. Before falling ill, he had spent a few days in Dandou, a village 32 km from Kissidougou, where he frequently went to do business. A total of 41 individuals in contact with the case in Kissidougou (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7), Mamou (
 <italic>n</italic> = 32) and Conakry (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) were identified by the field teams, and further sampled for LASV RT-PCR as per Ministry of Health National Strategy guidelines in the case of VHF suspicion even in the absence of symptoms. None of them were found positive for EBOV or LASV by RT-PCR (
