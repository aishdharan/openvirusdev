<p>Phylogenetic analysis shows that the LASV strain from the case, further named the Kissidougou strain, belongs to clade IV of the 
 <italic>Lassa mammarenavirus</italic> genus. This clade includes LASV known to circulate in Faranah (Upper Guinea) and in Macenta (Forest Guinea). Trees based on the combined complete glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01062-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) show that the Kissidougou strain is very closely related to a LASV strain identified in Liberia in 1981 (LIB-807987). Nucleotide similarities between these two strains are 88.9% for GP, 87.8% for NP and 86.7% for the polymerase. The amino acid translation gives similarities of 96.9% for GP, 96.0% for NP and 93.5% for the polymerase. The time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the Kissidougou and LIB-807987 cluster is estimated at 139 (95% Highest Posterior Density (HDP) interval: 119–160) years using the GPC and NP, and at 155 (95% HPD interval: 139–170) years using the polymerase. In addition, the analysis on the partial NP, including four more sequences published in Bowen et al. 2000 [
