<p>In Guinea, numerous LASV sequences have been largely described in rodents, notably in the region of Faranah (221 sequences), Kindia (6 sequences) and Guékedou (9 sequences) [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, only 5 sequences are derived from humans, 2 complete from Faranah and Macenta [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and 3 partials from Kissidougou and Nzérékoré [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our report represents thus the sixth description of a LASV strain isolated from humans in Guinea. It demonstrates the circulation of LASV in the surroundings of Kissidougou, which was already observed in 1960 among missionaries living in Telekoro near Kissidougou. Indeed, that historical study revealed that three individuals who had fever with long convalescence, with or without deafness, harboured LASV neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The child of one of the missionaries also had LASV-neutralizing antibodies without signs of a febrile episode. From 1996 to 1999, an investigation among patients hospitalized in Kissidougou revealed that six of them were Lassa seropositive [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-01062" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They came from villages around the town (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01062-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This therefore indicates that LASV has been circulating for 60 years in the Kissidougou area. Phylogenetic analysis of the polymerase indicates an older origin, dating back 155 (95% HPD interval: 139–170) years.
