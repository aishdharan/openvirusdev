<p>The strain described here is clearly related to the sequence LIB-807987 observed in 1981 in Liberia. It may be thus speculated that trades, including those related to the timber trade between Forest Guinea and Liberia, and commercial business favour LASV circulation between Kissidougou and Liberia. The case was, indeed, a logger merchant who used to sell wood in Forest Guinea without prior travel history to Liberia. Yet, a clear geographical origin (i.e., Liberia or Guinea-Kissidougou) for this sub-cluster remains speculative due to a lack of information about LIB-807987, as well as a lack of additional sequences. Thus, the name “Kissidougou cluster” is to highlight that it is different to that of the Macenta cluster but that it is also still part of the LASV known to circulate in Guinea. The Macenta cluster also includes three sequences, which, although identified in Liberia, originate from Macenta, Guinea, a town bordering Liberia. For example, the case described in 2018, the sequence of which is referenced under number LIB-LF18040 (MH215285 in Wiley et al. 2019), was a woman working at SOGUIPAH, near Macenta. She was diagnosed in Ganta, the neighbouring town in Liberia. The other large “Liberia” cluster, composed of sequences identified in, and originating from Lofa, Bong and Nimba counties in Liberia, forms a cluster independent from that of Guinea. Altogether, the description of this new strain allows us to speculate about a “Macenta” and a “Kissidougou” cluster circulating in Forest Guinea. These clusters appear to be more recent than the ones observed in Faranah, Upper Guinea, and in Liberia. This last country is probably the entry point of the virus in the Mano River region [
