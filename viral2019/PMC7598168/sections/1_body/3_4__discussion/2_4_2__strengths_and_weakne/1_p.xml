<p>In three weeks, the patient went through two health centres, one in Kissidougou and one in Mamou. Moreover, despite returning to the same health care facility in Kissidougou at a one week interval with worsened symptoms, no suspicion of VHF was considered. Even following his admission in a critical state at the CT-EPI of Mamou, the diagnosis of severe malaria continued to be considered. This indicates that the accurate and rapid clinical diagnosis of VHF in endemic areas is challenging, despite the 20142â€“016 Ebola virus disease epidemic in the country. This could be improved by providing regular awareness training on VHF case definitions and access to adequate communication tools (e.g., posters, flyers, drawings etc.).</p>
