 <caption> Time-calibrated phylogeny of the Lassa virus strains, gathering 41 sequences belonging to lineages IV and V (i.e., represented by “South Mali/North CIV”) and showing the new one from Kissidougou (in pink). The trees show the complete glycoprotein precursor and nucleoprotein in a linked model ( A), and the complete polymerase ( B). The trees were inferred by using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method, with GTR + gamma model, strict clock, constant population size and partitioning into codon positions 1, 2, 3. Posterior probabilities are coded as follows: 0.7, green dots; 0.80 to &lt; 0.85, purple-blue dots; &gt; 0.97, red dots. Geographical origins are noted on the right of each tree, and scale axis represents the time in years. </caption>
