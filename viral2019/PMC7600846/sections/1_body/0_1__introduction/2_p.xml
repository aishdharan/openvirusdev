<p>During the COVID-19 first wave in France, the hospital system underwent a dynamical reorganization to accommodate more patients in both intensive care and conventional hospitalization, with a doubling of the number of ICU beds. Characterizing patientsâ€™ trajectories in the hospital, especially the length of stay in different wards, is required to understand why and how the system had to change. This is necessary to plan for future demand in beds as renewed increase in circulation is occurring in many countries. Furthermore, it is also required to appreciate whether COVID-19 care improved over time, investigating mortality as well as admission to the ICU or length of stay to examine future capacity requirements more precisely. Information on the time between disease onset and admission to the hospital or to the intensive care unit (ICU) is also scarce in the literature and may be of use to help define best care.</p>
