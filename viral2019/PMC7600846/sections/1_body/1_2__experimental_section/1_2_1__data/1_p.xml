<p>Seven general hospitals participated in the study. All but one of these hospitals were from northern France and covered a large part of the local population. The last hospital was from eastern France, in the location where the first clusters of COVID-19 cases occurred. All patients aged ≥ 18 years old admitted for COVID-19 in one of the participating hospitals between 1 January and 31 May were included. COVID-19 diagnosis was based on positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test or evocative chest scan. For all patients, we obtained demographic data, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalization, and dates of transfer between wards (ICU or not). We also obtained dates and status at discharge or at the end of data collection. This multicentric observational study was registered to the French authorities under the numbers MR004-202004-006 (Annecy Genevois hospital) and MR04-2020-03 (Tourcoing hospital), using the MR-004 referral methodology of the “Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés”. Data transfer from hospitals to Institut Pierre Louis d’Epidémiologie et de Santé Publique was ruled by a transfer agreement between the three parties under the reference C20/0506. The data collection process was in line with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). </p>
