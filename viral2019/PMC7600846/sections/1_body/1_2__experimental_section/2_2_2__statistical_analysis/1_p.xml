<p>Patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital ultimately experienced one of two competing outcomes, death or discharge. Analyzing data on patient outcome and hospital trajectories during an epidemic is difficult because patients kept being admitted over the whole period and the hospital stay was long. Thus, some patients were still hospitalized at the time of data analysis. This leads to censoring in the data, as the ultimate event is unknown. Time-to-event analysis allows taking this into account. But the analysis of time spent in the hospital or in the ICU for an acute event such as COVID-19 needs a different perspective than usual time-to-event analysis, in which duration to the event defines the outcome. Indeed, the length of the hospital stay does not define a good or a bad outcome [

The time to reach the outcome is secondary but is necessary for capacity planning. Thus, time from disease onset to hospitalization was analyzed accounting for truncation (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jcm-09-03148">Statistical Methods in Supplementary Information</xref>). As initial inspection suggested a bimodal distribution, we fitted a mixture of 2 distributions to the data: an exponential distribution to capture “quick progressors” and a log-normal distribution for “slow progressors”. This analysis was made with proportions of quick/slow progressors according to age. Age was categorized into three category (18–65, 66–80, &gt;80 years) for balance between groups and because it corresponds with retirement (65 years old) and increased triage before ICU admission (80 years old).
