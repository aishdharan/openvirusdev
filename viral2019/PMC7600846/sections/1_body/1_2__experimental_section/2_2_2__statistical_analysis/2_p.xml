<p>For some patients, the final outcome, after hospital admission, was still unknown as they remained hospitalized. We, therefore, used parametric survival modelling to account for censoring of future events. An additional issue is that 2 outcomes are possible, death or discharge. We, therefore, fitted a mixture of parametric time-to-event distributions. In this approach, the total percentage of patients reaching each outcome is estimated independently from the time it takes to reach that outcome. We defined a trajectory as the sequence and timing of events from disease onset to final outcome. Before admission, we used the “quick” or “slow” progressors described above. After hospital admission, we described trajectories with 3 possible paths: the first was the admission to intensive care, the second a stay in conventional care ending in death, and the third ending in discharge. Then, for patients who entered the ICU, we modelled two further paths: death or discharge to conventional care. Patients who died in the week following discharge from the ICU were counted as dead in the ICU. When there was more than one ICU stay, the patient trajectory was simplified to a single stay in the ICU from the first entry to the last discharge from the ICU. Patients still hospitalized at the time of the study were right-censored according to the stage they had reached (ICU or hospitalization). We used log-normal distributions for the time to the event and estimated mean duration of stay in the successive wards from the fitted distributions, with a sensitivity analysis using exponential distributions. For the main analysis, we fixed the coefficient of variation for each outcome in each age class. Confidence intervals were determined using normal approximations. </p>
