<p>The mean time from onset to hospitalization decreased with age, from 7.3 days (+/−0.2 standard deviation, SD) in the ≤65 year-olds, to 6.2 days (+/−0.2) in the 65–80 and to 4.5 days (+/−0.2) in the &gt;80 year-olds (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The overall distribution was bimodal, with a first peak shortly after onset and a second peak in the second week after onset. The mixture analysis yielded the superposition of a “quick” exponential distribution with mean 4.1 days (+/−2) and a “slow” log-normal distribution with mean 9.2 days (+/−1.7). The proportion of “quick” progressors increased with age, from 26% in the ≤65 year-olds, to 44% in the 65–80 year-olds, and 90% in the &gt;80 year-olds (
