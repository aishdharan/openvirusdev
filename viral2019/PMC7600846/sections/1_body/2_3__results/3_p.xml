<p>The characteristics of patients’ trajectories are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-09-03148-f003">Figure 3</xref> and described with more detail in 
 <xref rid="jcm-09-03148-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Overall, patients stayed in the hospital for about 2 weeks. One patient out of 5 (20%) died after an average of 20 days in the hospital. During the course of the hospital stay, 1 patient out of 4 (25%) was admitted to the ICU shortly after admission within a span of 2 days on average. Admission in ICU was on the day of hospital admission for the majority of the patients (58%). The average time requiring intensive care was one month. The average length of stay in ICU was of 27 days +/− SD for those who survived (two-thirds) and of 45 days +/− SD for those who died (one-third). In the patients who did not go to the ICU, the length of stay was shorter overall (11 days +/− SD), with little difference between those discharged or those who died. The results were similar using exponential distributions, although durations were a bit shorter (see
