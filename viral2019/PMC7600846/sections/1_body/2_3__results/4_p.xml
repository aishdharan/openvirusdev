<p>The characteristics of these trajectories showed two marked differences with age. Older patients (66–80 and &gt;80-year-old) were less likely to be admitted in ICU and had a higher mortality (

 <xref rid="jcm-09-03148-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). More precisely, overall mortality increased with age from 9% in the ≤65-year-old to 38% in the &gt;80-year-old patients, while ICU admission respectively decreased from 30% to 7%. The overall length of stay was also affected by age, with shorter stays for older patients who died but longer stays when they were discharged alive. The converse was observed in the younger patients (≤65-year-old).
