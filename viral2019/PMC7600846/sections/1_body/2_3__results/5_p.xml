<p>The overall risk of death increased with age (
 <xref rid="jcm-09-03148-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) with OR = 2.5 (CI 95% [1.3, 4.9]) for the 65â€“80 years old, and OR = 6.4 (CI 95% [3.4, 12.2]) for the &gt;80 years old, relative to the less than 65 years old. In addition to age, we found that risk factors for death included hospitalization in the 5 days after onset rather than later, irrespective of age (adusted odds-ratio, aOR = 1.8, CI 95% [1.3, 2.6], adjusted for age) and being a male patient (aOR = 2.1, CI 95% [1.5, 2.9], adjusted for age).
