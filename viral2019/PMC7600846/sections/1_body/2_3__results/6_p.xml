 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-09-03148-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows that expected mortality in newly admitted patients decreased over time. The raw odds ratios for mortality, relative to the period ending 15 March, were 0.78 [0.5, 1.2] from 15 March to 1 April, 0.71 [0.4, 1.1] from 1 April to 15 April, and 0.70 [0.4, 1.3] afterwards. Yet, the mean age of patients at admission increased at first during the course of the outbreak, reaching 70 years old at the time of the lockdown, decreased down to 63 years during the lockdown, at the time of the epidemic peak, to increase again afterward. To disentangle age effects form that of reduction in mortality over time, we computed age-adjusted odds ratios of death over time. Relative to the period ending on March 15, these were 0.79 [0.5, 1.3] from 15 March to 1 April, 0.57 [0.33, 0.97] from 1 April to 15 April, and 0.36 [0.18, 0.72] afterwards, showing larger reduction in mortality once changes in age were taken into account. The median time spent in the hospital was similar over the first three periods and increased in the last fortnight (
