<p>During the course of the disease, we found that approximately one patient out of four required intensive care. The time to ICU admission was short, in the two days following admission for the most part. This highlights again that the disease can progress rapidly, with major consequences in hospital organization. Knowing that a fourth of patients will be transferred in ICU, and the majority during the first three days, since hospital admission is of key importance for bed management in ICUs. Furthermore, starting treatments as soon as possible after admission to the hospital might avoid clinical aggravation and transfer to the ICU [

A striking feature was that old patients were admitted less frequently to the ICU than others. Criteria for admission to the ICU may change during a pandemic situation, to favor younger patients when the bed capacity in ICU is low [
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-09-03148" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, older patients were also less frequently admitted to the ICU during the 2009 influenza pandemic [
 <xref rid="B15-jcm-09-03148" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], when shortage of ICU beds was not an issue. This suggests that the participating hospitals did not significantly alter the rules of triage for admission to the ICU during the course of the outbreak.
