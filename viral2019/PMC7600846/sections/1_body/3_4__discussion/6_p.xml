<p>The overall mortality rate was 20%, with strong variation depending on age. This is in accordance with other research where older male patients were reported to be more likely to die [

Importantly, we found that overall mortality had substantially decreased over time, all the more when differences in case-mix were taken into account. This suggests that patient management improved over time. While we do not have data to confirm it, those of us who treated the patients resorted more frequently to anticoagulation drugs and corticosteroids over time, as well as to high-flow oxygen therapy. These drugs and procedures have been linked to better outcomes for the patients [
